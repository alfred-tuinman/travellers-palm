The lake here, around which the whole town revolves, is considered to ne extremely holy and a bath here is second only to one in the Ganges at Varanasi. Hundreds of small temples are built on the periphery of the lake. Well designed, wide stone steps lead down to the lake. These are called the `ghats'. Devotees come to worship at the temples and on the ghats early every morning and at sunset too. Prayers and chanted, hymns are sung, and devotional music is played at the temples.

Pushkar is also known for its annual ""Camel Fair"". Traditionally, when devotees would come on a pilgrimage at the time of the first full moon of the Hindu year, they would bring along their cattle, camels and brisk trade would take place. It is now one of the largest fairs of its kind and attracts thousands of people. This is a fantastic opportunity to see people in traditional, ceremonial attire, entire families having travelled considerable distance to attend the fair. The various animals are displayed in their finery and there are competitions and races too. 

Pushkar Palace is one of the oldest hotels in Pushkar and is located right on the banks of the lake. Until recently, the hotel had a fabulous sunset terrace with well tended palm trees and other mature trees. A zealous town council decreed that the garden was violating the public space and tore it down. Minus the terrace, the Pushkar Palace still has lovely views from the suites which are right next to the lake and from the upper floors of the main wing. A small garden is in the centre and this is a delightful place to sit and relax.

The management informs that they will be re-doing them soon.   

At Wild Grass the emphasis is very much on the environment and wildlife, and that is reflected in the high quality naturalists. The staff of Wild Grass all hail from Kaziranga, and the surrounding villages and this gives them an excellent combination of local knowledge and academic expertise.

Even within the compound, trees are well signposted with their botanical and common names for identification. Over two hundred species of birds have been recorded in the vicinity of the lodge.

The reception and bar are in the front verandah, bathed in a delicate glow from the bright coloured chic blinds. Well padded cane chairs around marble tables make a good vantage point to watch the activity. Inside is a handsome, high ceilinged family drawing room with an impressive collection of armour and portraits of family members. Do not miss the frescoes and other Raj memorabilia.

Most rooms have a cosy seating area and also access to a verandah.

Castle Mandawa has a lovely swimming pool and also offers spa facilities, a pool and billiards table, and a table tennis table.

The final stretch leads through the cobbled stone streets of the Samode village to an enormous arched gateway. Then you come face to face with the Palace. 

The first sight of the palace is spectacular. Climbing the impressive flight of steps gives you enough time to admire the building. An amazing number of windows and carved friezes face you. From inside another pair of gates, the inner courtyards unfold. 

Samode Palace consists of a succession of courtyards, each with a different mood. Note the flowering creepers, flaming bougainvillea, stately palms, brass pots holding smaller palms, and large marble tubs decorated with floating petals. The overall impression is of contained luxury and sophistication. 

The rooms at Samode Palace are in wings accessed via the various courtyards. They are all decorated in a style that can be described as Royal Rajput meets western sophistication. Paisley prints, re-interpreted motifs in smooth cottons, tasteful durries on the floors, colourful bed covers and curtains, and extremely comfortable mattresses. The spacious bathrooms are some of the best in India with premium quality fixtures and fittings, and even have separate shower cubicles.

The suites, and in particular the Royal suites, are extraordinarily beautiful. The Royal Suites have private terraces overlooking the hillside and an oudoor Jacuzzi to enjoy the views. If there is one place where you should splurge, this is it. 

There are also public areas of immense beauty such as the Sultan Mahal, the Sheesh Mahal and the grandest one of them all, the Durbar Hall, acknowledged to have the finest examples of Shekhavati style frescoes.  The Durbar Hall is literally painted all the way to its lofty ceilings. High fanlights let in natural light giving the room a glow that is unparalleled. 

The artistically designed pool is to one side, as is an air-conditioned restaurant. Food can be served in the main dining hall, around the pool deck, or in the central courtyard.  Romantic dinners can be arranged at many of the secluded locations and terraces.

In keeping with the beautiful natural surroundings, recreational and leisure facilities include a health complex by the pool comprising a fully equipped fitness centre, sauna, steam and changing rooms. The emphasis has been placed on creating a quiet and relaxed atmosphere. There is also a Kerala Ayurvedic Centre (famous world over for the herbal oil massages). 

A note of caution would be that if you have mobility problems or are disabled, then this palace is probably not for you as there are no lifts and no wheelchair ramps due to the historical nature of the building.",,samode-palace,"A fairytale palace nestled picturesquely amid rugged hills.

The charm of the resort is obvious immediately on arrival by boat, pulling up right in front of the reception.

Some rooms are housed in yellow cottages separate from the main building. Although younger in age, the rooms here continue with the English country cottage theme - peach and pistachio green walls, and metal canopy beds. The overall effect is regal, yet still very warm and inviting.

There are a number of common areas and restaurants to choose from. The Tiger Lounge is really a stylish boys' den. Tiger trophies from various erstwhile princely states adorn the walls. The glassed multi-cuisine restaurant has been designed to take full advantage of the views over the bamboos and tall deodar trees that surround it. The more formal dining room area, the Imperial Banquet Room, is presided over by a buffalo head trophy and serves special Himachali cuisine on request.

Later we were astounded to see the nearby City Palace, a stunning place which is still the private property of the royal family. Complete with painted durbar hall, a myriad of terraces, balconies, pavilions and grand rooms, the City Palace is an absolute treasure trove of architecture. 

Under the British rule, Karauli was a state worthy of a 17 gun salute! As a result, there were many occasions of state visits and hunting parties. The formal drawing room of the Palace is full of family memorabilia from that era. 

The meals are served in the family dining area - the kitchen is just behind and is the same one which caters to the Royal family. His Highness, Krishna Chandra Pal is often in residence, and guests may well find him seated next to them at dinner-time. 

When we first visited the Bhanwar Vilas Palace in the late 1980s, there were just 4 bedrooms in the main building, all large and gracious with a lot of old word charm.

Back then, the lodge was in a sadly neglected state, but one could see the potential. Over the next few years, Swaroop Singh restored the lodge into an exceptionally enjoyable hideaway. 

The work he started was continued after his death by his two dynamic and talented sons. Touches of modern chic were introduced by the young head of the family, Raghuveer Singh Rathore. He is a designer, celebrated for his use of a mix of Indian and Western styles. 

A courtyard welcomes you with blooming bougainvillea climbing along white washed walls. The garden within the fortress-like walls has green lawns, day-beds draped in white muslin and small statues hidden here and there.

With this aim it was built close to the Machchu River so that cool winds would blow over it, and this is the reason why it also features a 3 storey step well complete with sculptures and carvings of both Indian and Greco-Roman gods. The faded yellow and white of this 19th century building is enlivened by the Art Deco colours and designs that decorate its interiors. 

The grounds of the Royal Oasis are large with shade giving trees and slightly unkempt lawns. The main building sits in the centre of these with a colonial style arched gateway with a garden of marble benches and statues to match. 

The rooms have dark wood floors and light pastel coloured walls, with the beds and furniture belonging firmly to the Art Deco period. The bathrooms are modern but still quaintly 1940's. There are 2 suites in the Royal Oasis - the Queen's Room and the King's Rooms. Both evoke a sense of faded grandeur as a result of the slightly moth eaten leopard skins on the floor and their shiny cerulean blue cupboards, and a sense of the utterly bizarre because of the bathrooms that are made entirely from mirrored and coloured black glass. 

Dinner is served in a room surrounded by photos of the royal family and speckled green walls to match the dining table and chairs. Dinner is an elaborate affair with a fixed menu involving Indian vegetarian and meat dishes. 

The most fascinating feature of the Royal Oasis is surely the step well or ""vaav"" which is a mixture of Hindu, Islamic, Gothic and Art Deco architecture, and is housed in a separate building. The scarcity of water in the state of Gujarat was responsible for the popularity of step wells and while you are likely to see a few different varieties of them, this one is quite likely to be the most memorable, inspite of its slightly green and murky water. Its floral arches, inlaid stone work and carved stone ""chatri"" cenotaphs are delightful.",,royal-oasis,"Located in lush green gardens, the summer palace of the Maharaja of Wankaner is a true Art Deco bungalow.

Each raft is steered by a qualified rafting guide who is there to ensure your safety.  No risks are taken and if the guide determinse that certain sections of the river are not suitable for rafting, their decision is final.

Grade I - Relaxing - Waves are so small you may not even get wet.
Grade II - Easy does it - Clear passages and moderate waves.

The rooms are on varying levels; they are spacious, bright, beautifully furnished, and feature round beds in the turret rooms. The interiors have maybe made a bit too generous a use of mirrors and opulent fabrics but the overall effect remains stylish and impressive.

There are beautiful panoramic views from everywhere - don't miss the sunset from the makeshift bar at the top of the fort! ","Karni Fort's dining area is on the uppermost level and the views of sunset and early mornings are very dramatic. 

The swimming pool, located down the slope in its own area, is clad in marble with a marble pavilion floating in the centre! Carved elephants spout steady streams of water.

The royal crest of Jammu and Kashmir on its doors reveals its present owners to be the erstwhile royal family of that highly disputed state. 

Built in the cool shadows of the Dhauladhar mountains to be the summer residence of a Nawab, the Taragarh Palace was later acquired for the dowager Queen of Jammu and Kashmir. 

For all its illustrious history, the Palace hotel is a fairly modern establishment with a seasonal swimming pool, exercise facilities, and telephones and televisions in each of its grandly furnished room.   

The newer wing is a sturdy, red brick building. Less graceful than the original building, this is a low bungalow with a painted wooden facade and filigree like fretwork. However as alluring as it is to stroll through the tiger skin lined corridors of the heritage wing, it is the rooms in the modern wing that are surprisingly the more appealing. Larger and sunnier, these rooms have queen sized, 2 poster beds, cool marble patterned floors and brick fireplaces. The bathrooms are equally elegant and modern, some even have marble bathtubs.

The dining area is a large, exposed brick affair with charming wood and brass ceiling fans and large figurines of deer on the long tables, designed for formal dining.
 
Outside on their lawns are benches under trees and canopies, a cordoned off section for the prized polo ponies and a pool behind the green roofed heritage wing.

A road climbs past thick bushes of fuchsia pink bougainvillea and up to the serene villas of the Gateway hotel perched on Pasumalai Hill. Built in 1890 to house the owner of a textile company, the villas sit at a sedate distance from each other. Although rooms have been added on to the original structure, they have retained the country style terracotta floors, dainty fretwork and red rooves of the older buildings. The turn-of-the-century grace of the building and the rolling lawns are reminiscent of the days of the Raj.
 
The colonial era rooms are generously sized with light wood floors and sometimes large French windows. The furniture leans towards the classical style, covered with heavy brocade and chintz in brown and gold tones. Carnations and rose petals floating in bowls give a splash of red to the black and white bathrooms. 

The open air barbeque restaurant commands a birds' eye view of the city, while the indoor restaurant offers a range of cuisines. Peacocks roam the terraced gardens.
 
The swimming pool is large and is surrounded by swaying palm trees, with the sunbeds arranged facing the panoramic views of Madurai.

The result was the impressive Lallgarh Palace.

The opulent Lallgarh Palace draws its inspiration largely from the Rajput tradition. Its facade, like a Rajput fort, has almost no decorative features, except its topping of arrayed cupolas. But there is also a strong touch of the Renaissance in the way the palace has been laid out, with its collonades and corridors. 

Bikaner's royal family produced many statesmen who regularly met with India's British rulers. As a result, Lallgarh Palace saw the maximum number of visiting dignitaries from British India. Walking through the broad corridors flanked by a long colonnade of elegant pillars, it is easy to imagine those days. The public chambers such as the dining hall, the drawing room, the library and the bar, are large and furnished in a heavy masculine, royal style.

The central courtyard and the expansive gardens soften the austere feel. There is a tennis court, croquet grounds, billiards table and much more. Even if you are not inclined towards sports, the grounds are most pleasant for walks and ambling.

The palace overlooks the Gaibsagar lake, and offers delightful views and some excellent birdwatching in the winter months. 

The beautifully designed swimming pool borders the lake beyond and has some fabulous carved statues around.  

The palace has a central courtyard with a most unusual structure - Ek Khambiya mahal - a miniature tower intricately carved in deep grey stone with contrasting accents in white marble. This central courtyard gives the palace a totally unique identity. 

The Udai Bilas is an intimate property with only 22 suites and rooms. The overall ambience of the palace and the interiors is of the late Art-Deco period. The suites are extremely large and offer some of the best views of the lake. The standard rooms, in their own wing, are smaller, but they are still charming and comfortable and offer a view of the pool.

Another attraction is the Dungarpur Mews, a 100-years-old heritage building, initially used to stable horses and carriages and then extended to make it a huge garage in the 1930s. The current owner, Harsh Vardhan, has spruced up the old building to showcase some old carriages used in the pre-independence era, some old British cannons, a great collection of vintage cars, a couple of WW1 BMW motorcycles, and even two DH- 5 aicraft!

The mews has a nice bar with music and it is a great place to party in the midst of all the old cars and other modes of transport.

From 1986, the ruins of this Fort were sensitively restored and reconstructed into a magnificent Palace hotel.  

An enormous entrance gate leads into the fort. You pass smaller gates, and ascend a stone-paved ramp to the main level of the fort. Here you will find the reception and most of the common areas.  Rooms literally head off in all directions, through various staircases, passageways and terraces. 

The rooms come in all sizes and themes, each with its own descriptive name, and are decorated in an eclectic fashion, with a combination of Rajasthani and colonial furniture and colourful fabrics. There are some exquisite pieces of furniture. Most rooms have access to balconies or terraces which offer superb views. The suites are superb -- our favourites being the Chandra Mahal with its black and white decor, Francisi Mahal with its elegant poster beds, and Kailash Burj with its unusual round shape.

The many superb common areas include various terraces, indoor and outdoor dining venues, lily pools and a swimming pool with a deck. The pool in a secluded location is accessed by a series of steps and winding passages. The pool is built with traditional Rajasthani motifs and small steps built in the style of a step-well go down one side. The deck overlooks the valley and gardens below and is an excellent place to watch the sunset.

Another good place to watch the sunset is the large terrace just past the main entrance, on the lower level. This terrace offers great views not only of the terrace but also a large section of the imposing fort facade with balconies, cupolas and canopied windows. 

Meals are served in different venues, depending on the season. One of the most impressive is an open-air courtyard created by high old walls with partial views through arches and high windows.

12 years ago Jungle Retreat was a sericulture plantation devoid of trees and vegetation. On their 35 acres, the owners began a regeneration and reforestation program, which continues today; protecting and planting diverse species local to the area. Over a hundred species of birds and a whole herd of spotted deer now delight their visitors. More recently Malabar Giant Squirrels, Flying Squirrels and peacocks have begun to frequent the land. On rare occasions even leopards are seen. 

The swimming pool is built to resemble a watering hole. Besides employing 80% local staff, Jungle Retreat have gone a step further and now run a specialist programme in which they train, and subsequently provide work opportunities to, members of the local community. They learn about the importance of interpretation, being responsible guides, and about nature including ornithology (birds) and herpetology (reptiles).

The gurgling of streams and the chirping and hooting of birds is all the company you can expect. 

Located off the main road, and approached by a steep dirt track, Vythiri Resort is located in a dramatic section of the forest. The resort is spread over 150 acres, with its own ravines, streams and plantations. 

A bamboo bridge crosses a small ravine to reach the rooms from the reception area - one one of the many adventurous elements of staying at Vythiri. There are different kinds of rooms, most in cottages and some in tree houses.
 
The age old trees near Vythiri soar high over the smaller ones, their canopies reaching many meters above ground. The tree houses are built on strong platforms resting on the forks in the branches. The access to one of these is an ingenious pulley (operated on the principle of counter-weights) cage! Once in the tree house, you are entirely surrounded by the tree tops. Spending a night there is an unbelievable experience. 

Even if this kind of adventure is not for you, there is plenty to be enjoyed while living closer to terra firma. Every room has a balcony from which you can enjoy the forest which surrounds you. Day and night, the forest is alive with birdsong. Some of the largest butterflies in India can be see here. 

The resort has a good sized pool, a health club, an Ayurveda centre and a restaurant serving Kerala delicacies as well as a choice of Continental cuisine.",,vythiri-resort,"This resort was one of the first to come up in the beautiful Wayanad district of Kerala, famous for its rainforests and plantation at high elevation.","Vythiri Resort in Vythiri - Travel in India | Travellers Palm","vythiri resort, wayanad, kerala, rainforest, tree houses, birds, special places",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You approach the Camel Camp along a dusty desert road until you reach a large fort-like entrance. This grand entrance adds a surreal touch to what is a whimsically luxurious tented camp. The camp is the brainchild of Reggie Singh, grandson of Maharaj Ratan Singh - a royal of Jodhpur, famous for his polo and shikaar exploits.

The camp comprises spacious and luxurious tents furnished with colourful dhurries, solid wooden beds, a dressing table with mirror, and a small luggage rack. The inside fabric of the tents is also printed with traditional motifs, making them cheerful and bright. The bathrooms are imaginative, with stone flooring and a wash basin, toilet, and shower area. Each tent has a small patio in front with easy lounging chairs.

The central covered area has a thatched bar and restaurant. The long bar has informal lounge style chairs on two different levels. The atmosphere is very much like that of a game lodge, with photos from the old hunting days adorning the mud-plastered walls. On the other side is the dining hall which is enclosed by knee high walls. Along a long wall are the buffet and dining tables. On winter nights the many lamps and candles create a warm ambience. 

Nearby, on another level, is the swimming pool - a touch of unashamed luxury in the desert. A simple, thatch covered pavilion offers shade in the blazing afternoons. From this height, there are extensive views over the desert.
 
Around the Camel Camp are some of the highest dunes of the Thar Desert. A camel ride here is an exhilarating experience. You mount camels from the bottom of the dune and return to camp in time for sunset and champagne cocktails by the poolside.","

It didn't have any of the conventional `must have' features of hotels otherwise found in Goa, such as a large lobby, a reception, 24 hours coffee shop, room service, etc!  

What it did have is rooms hidden away on several levels amongst vast gardens, a swimming pool large enough to hold all the guests at the same time, and a total sense of privacy. Generally, only in-house guests have the access to the property, which perches atop the Arpora hill, with the coastline visible past paddy fields and coconut groves.  

The rooms, named after various natural elements, like earth, fire etc, are designed in Claudia's impeccable if startlingly bold style. Vibrant colours liven up the walls, there are amazing pillars, and even special acoustic chambers for meditation. The furniture is often of wrought iron or wood.  One thing Nilaya was and remains is uniquely original. 

A beautifully designed dining area overlooks the swimming pool and the horizon beyond. There are also tables scattered in the large gardens.",,nilaya-hermitage,"Cutting edge chic on a hill-top.

Pousada's twelve suites are in cottages, and all are based on various charming themes; Sea, Garden, Castle, Field and Mountain.  Each suite has its own private sit-out, a lounge/living area and a spacious bedroom. The furniture and furnishings are specifically made for the particular room. The overall ambience is one of elegance in a country style - no polished marbles or smelly wall to wall carpets here. Arched windows let in plenty of bright sunlight. There is also a complete Ayurveda spa in its own separate area. Underneath is a well equipped gym. 

Sitting out near your own suite either on the terrace or the gardens, you will be amazed at the sheer variety of rare plants interspersed with lily ponds and water bodies. To one end of the garden, is a large, man-made lagoon filled with Koi.

The long, handsome front lobby has a formal feel, but the staff is warm and welcoming. The large, stately rooms all overlook the manicured gardens and Kanchenjunga beyond. 

The rooms at the Silver Oaks hotel are grand, both in their size and decor. Deep, forest greens and royal reds colour the rooms and the glossy hardwood floors bear thick carpets. The clean lines and round edges of the furniture speak of a return to Art Deco chic - elegant but unimposing. The rooms are built on a generous scale and offer wide views.

The dining room is, again, a slightly formal space with straight backed, skinny wooden chairs and crisp white linen tablecloths, and offers Indian and Continental food. The bar, on the other hand, is a snug, warmer area whose round bay window looks out over the front lawn.

Kalimpong's busy shopping streets are a mere 5 minute walk away from the peace and quiet of the hotel's lawns.",,silver-oaks,"Once a boarding house for the Britishers away from the hot and dusty plains, Silver Oaks now offers 25 rooms of great charm.

Nalagarh was the capital of the 12th century kingdom of Hindoor, founded by Raja Ajay Chand. A part of the capital was a dried up flood plain, which explains the name -'nala-garh'. The garh, or fort, was built in 1421, by Raja Bikram Chand, on a hillock about 1400 feet high. The rulers of Hindoor trace their origins to the Chandela Rajputs of Bundelkhand.

This is a charming 1760's manor house located in the heart of the French Quarter. Sensitively restored and furnished with French colonial antiques, it captures the period grandeur of a colonial nobleman's mansion.

There are sixteen rooms with colonial furniture such as four-poster beds, planters chairs, dowry chests and large old mirrors filling the high-beamed spaces. Each of the guest rooms - set around an inner courtyard shaded by citrus and neem trees - is themed and named for a former French colony.

Since every effort was made to alter as little as possible of the original structure, the rooms come in a charming range of shapes and sizes, some resemble a cosy loft, some are large and majestic, and others have a private terrace. Each room has been named after French ""possessions"" (Gingy in Tamil Nadu, 'Surate' in Gujarat etc) in India and in their differing decor reflect the flavours of the diverse regions.  

The ceilings are lofty, the beds high and heavily carved, and there are loungers and divans in every room. The walls are either shiny with age or have a delightful mottled effect due to the layers of paint. The bathrooms have been completely modernized but still have charm, with rough stone floors, maybe even an old brass bucket, and with fragrant Neemrana bath products to pamper yourself with.

Apart from the wrought iron tables and chairs arranged in the inner courtyard, food is also served indoors, in a peach room dotted with old French ""cartes"" (maps) of India.

The resort offers Ayurveda, Yoga,  Aromatherapy as well as Himalayan spring water therapy. The well designed pool and steam/sauna complete a world class spa resort.
  
Although the building that houses the rooms is fairly square and uninspired, the rooms inside are special. Furnished with an eye for beauty and detail, the rooms are plush but understated - creams and beiges, meditation symbols hang in prints on the walls. A wonderful balcony presents high, bird's eye views of the wooded slopes and silvery Ganges below, perfect for breakfast or a romantic dinner. The rooms have walk in closets and tubs to soak in. 
  
Experts are on hand to recommend which of the 79 body and beauty treatments would best achieve the health goals you've set yourself. While the many therapies, yoga and meditation practices and massage techniques may be found elsewhere also, it is in Ananda that there are found all under one roof (albeit at a certain price). Aside from these there is also the large lap pool to relax in and evening entertainment in their amphitheatre. 
  
The chefs at Ananda design menus with not only taste in mind but also the ayurvedic division of body types. But Ananda encourages you not to look at your stay here as a quick fix-it solution to your health concerns. They instead see it as only the first step in a lifestyle change. So chefs at Ananda work from an open kitchen so that you are able to observe the dishes they create and replicate them at home. Similarly, during the yoga and meditation sessions the instructors will be able to formulate a meditation programme for you to follow at home.",,mandarin-oriental-ananda-the-himalayas,"A luxurious spa resort built around a Maharaja's palace near Rishikesh.

Elsewhere,Goa,2018,"A slim slice of pure paradise, the Elsewhere villas - the Captain's House, the Piggery, the Bakery and the Priest's House - straddle a narrow piece of land between the sea and a creek. 

The rustic villas sit well away from each other and house a world of comfort within. Their earthy coloured walls and fat white balustrades shelter many a lounge chair, fluffy white beds, and traditional dark wood cupboards. They are just a stone's throw away from one of the most beautiful beaches in Goa.

",,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The villas have been charmingly named for their original purposes. The piggery, for example, was used to house livestock and the priest lived in his villa well into the 1950's. But they were lovingly and stylishly restored by Denzil Sequeira, the great grandson of the original owner, who is a prominent fashion photographer in Mumbai. 

His artist's eye is clearly seen in bold use of colours like ochre, deep rust and blazing white and the precise placement of Goan curios such as enamel cookware, hand woven baskets and metal pots. But Denzil's deep affection for Elsewhere would not allow him to make any changes to the real essence of his ancestral home. And the result is a preservation of the traditional Goan architectural elements of the house - the tiled roofs, the laterite and mud walls, and the broad verandahs that instantly invite you to sit down and enjoy the sea breeze.

At Elsewhere, modern world comes to a halt and is firmly kept away by the wooden walkway bridge which is the lone access to the villas - no television sets, no ringing telephones and no cars. Just gently swaying palm trees and the warm sea which is a stone's throw away.  Here, only the essential, the restorative and the nostalgic are allowed in.",,elsewhere,"A slim slice of pure paradise, the Elsewhere villas - the Captain's House, the Piggery, the Bakery and the Priest's House, straddle a narrow piece of land between the sea and a creek. ","Elsewhere in Goa - Travel in India | Travellers Palm","elsewhere, beach, villa, ashvem, mandrem, goa, special places, hotel",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

",,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The only viable accommodation option for exploring the Tadoba Tiger Reserve, Tiger Trails Jungle Lodge consists of 2 standalone cottages with 7 rooms. The rooms are in fact located inside the core area of the park making it a unique accommodation experience. Tigertrails has its own fleet of safari vehicles and also has many machans (watchtowers) on its private land from where one can observe wildlife.

Amrut Dhanwatay, the man behind Tiger Trails and the one responsible for reviving the many acres of previously over-grazed land around his property, is an Environmental Engineer and has been conferred the title of Honorary Wildlife Warden by the state government.  

The rooms, in keeping with most nature lodges, are fairly simple, but they are large and extremely clean and comfortable. The orange ceramic tiles on the floor are warm, the beds adequate and the bathrooms well appointed. There is running hot water but no air conditioning. None is required however as even in the winter months the surrounding forest keeps the temperature pleasant.

Since all meals are included and the fresh air of the surroundings tends to improve the appetite, the owners have wisely decided on providing food which is as close as possible to the light, non greasy food of Indian homes. Buffets are of the local food of the region - lightly spiced, utterly delicious and not often served in restaurants. The ingredients are more than likely to have been grown in the owner's own fields and the results are a delight. 

A definite highlight of the stay is also speaking with and learning from Amrut and his son Aditya, on their efforts to salvage the forest, educate the local people on their role in wildlife conservation, and their desire to support the surrounding villagers. One of them will accompany you on the park rides. Guests often find themselves chatting with the hosts well in to the night around the crackling bonfire that welcomes you back from the afternoon safari.",,tigertrails,"Tigertrails is a private jungle lodge run by Amrut Dhanwatay and his son Aditya.

For the more sedate guests, there is a swimming pool with the most dramatic views in Goa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Far away from the beach, where Goa borders its neighbours, Maharashtra and Karnataka, lies the Wildernest resort. Wildernest is set on over 450 acres of forest land overlooking the stunning Swapnagandha Valley.

Many may have heard of the mineral mines that have destroyed so much of Goa's hills and forests. Well, Wildernest is a case where one such denuded hill was re-planted by someone with his priorities (and heart) in the right place. Today, the 300 acres are thickly covered once again with continuous efforts at re-forestation. The hills are once again alive with the sound of birds and other wildlife. 

One of the founders is young Nirmal Kulkarni, Goa's best known conservationist and naturalist. Nirmal has worked long and hard in these hills and is a true champion of Goa's ecology. 

But is the resort attractive to a tourist who may not be so keen to be involved in any ecological struggle while they are on a holiday? The answer is yes! There are naturalist led walks and hikes for the intrepid. For the more sedate guests, there is the swimming pool, possibly the most dramatic in Goa. Seeming to hang over the several hundred feet deep valley below and surrounded by high green hills, the swimming pool is the single biggest attraction of Wildernest.

The cottages, named after fragrant local flowers, are spread in the light woods around the main restaurant/lounge area. They are entirely wooden, with high ceilings, comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms. Each cottage has a sit-out or a verandah overlooking either the forest or the valley below. Both views are magnificent. 

The resort employs only local people from these hilly areas. The staff members are warm and simple and extremely eager to share the many delights of the resort and its surrounding area. 

So, if you would like to explore Goa beyond the usual sun drenched beaches, travel up to Wildernest.

She heard the firing at Jallianwallah Bagh in 1919 and her efforts at sowing clothes for refugees during the Partition were praised even by Lord Mountbatten. Outliving two husbands, Mrs. Bhandari converted the brick and bougainvillea covered home into a guesthouse and ran it for some 50 years in order to support her family. 

Mrs Tehmi Bhandari sadly passed away a few years ago but her daughters now manage the place and have succeeded in preserving the atmosphere of an old army guesthouse - the furniture is functional but charming, the colours art-deco pastels and there are buffaloes to supply fresh milk and cream everyday. 

The rooms come in all shapes and sizes and are housed in outhouses placed around the main building. What they may lack in modern facilities, is more than made up for by their character and nostalgic feel with claw footed bathtubs resting on patterned tiles, pink, yellow and green walls and chairs and dressing tables of the unmistakable clean-lined art-deco variety. The rooms even have functional fireplaces and the wood for it is provided at extra charge. 

There are neat English lawns at the front and back of the property brightened by pink roses, red pansies and multicoloured dahlias. A simple cement pool is filled with water during the summer months and offers respite from the dry Amritsar heat. Delicious, Indian home cooked food is served on the lawn during summer evenings. 

Breakfasts are enlivened by the thick milk and cream that the buffaloes provide. The buffaloes aren't the only animals around; several friendly dogs roam the property and only add to the laid back, unpretentious atmosphere of the place.

The guesthouse is located outside the city of Amritsar, but the Golden Temple is only 20 minutes by cycle rickshaw.",,mrs-bhandaris-guesthouse,"A very pleasant, comfortable and, above all, homely place in which to enjoy genuine Punjabi hospitality.

As you pass the main north Goa road from Calangute to Anjuna, you will see some colourful flags fluttering among paddy fields. This is Yoga Magic. There are tents spread around the well tended plantation of coconuts and other local trees. Each tent is covered by a thatch roof thus keeping it cool and giving a large shaded sit-out at the front. 

The electricity is provided by small solar panels just outside each tent. The tents are spacious, easily putting to shame many hotel rooms. There are beds and bedside tables with plenty of space to walk around. Beyond the bedroom, there is a dressing/lounge area with a comfortable mattress spread Indian style on the floor. True to the ecologically sound policies of Yoga Magic, the toilets use no chemicals. The pot itself is squat style and once you are finished, you have to sprinkle the matter with wood shavings and then spray it with a special liquid that helps to bio-degrade the waste in record time. This then is used as manure in the gardens, especially for the banana and other fruit trees. The method obviously works, as these are some of the most odour-free toilets we have come across! 

Yoga Magic holds special yoga and meditation residential camps. There is a large, thatched space which serves as the venue for the classes for yoga and meditation. An Ayurveda massage specialist is at hand to take away any aches and pains.

The old building was completely refinished with a traditional lime plaster known as ""Chettinad Egg Plaster."" In this process, walls are covered with layer after layer of a thin coating of egg white, powdered sea shells and yogurt. Each layer is polished by hand, and the result is a uniquely smooth and soft texture.

The exquisite woodwork, perhaps the best example of French Indian carved woodwork in Pondicherry, is all original, recovered from the house of Joseph Francois Dupleix, which used to stand on the old Nehru Street. Dupleix was the greatest of the Generals and Governers of French India. During his tenure, the French were the dominant power in South India and the British were contained to Madras.

The original building has been expanded, and the hotel has been modernised with the use of materials such as glass and metal to create a delicate mix of modernity and tradition. This mix offers the warmth of the old, but at the same time ensures that the hotel is comfortable and efficient, equipped with Internet connections, mini bars, room service, and imported bathtubs and fittings. It is in this harmony between the traditional and modern that Le Dupleix exists not just as another heritage hotel, but as a unique and striking designer hotel.

There is indoor or outdoor dining, a patio area with sunbeds and a decent swimming pool and upstairs also boasts a large residents lounge and veranda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The bungalow was built in 1912 and run as a workshop and office of a UK Company called United Carpets engaged in the manufacture and export of coir and spices. Brooke Bond, the tea company, bought the bungalow in 1956 and christened it Brooke Bond Bungalow which housed the top management of Brooke Bond & Company. Dignitaries used this bungalow for important meetings. 

By the time it was sold again, some 50 years later, it was empty and semi-derelict. A 2-year restoration followed, and in 2009 it re-emerged as a small heritage hotel. Its history of spice and tea brought about its new avatar - Tea Bungalow. 

Tea Bungalow has 10 large en-suite rooms each named after a port involved in spice and tea trading from lands around the Indian Ocean. The rooms are named Cochin, Zanzibar, Galle, Mombasa, Muscat, Malacca, Mauritius, Cambay, Goa and Calicut. Each room has deft design touches of each ethnic port. 

The Tea Bungalow blends the history as a residence for execs of the tea company, with the modernity of a western 'boutique' hip hotel style. Polished hardwood floors, French windows, floor length drapes, high ceiling red tiled roof and an exquisite chandelier are complemented by vibrant colours and beautifully designed modern bathrooms. 

Centrally located, the hotel is just a five minute walk from key sights in Fort Cochin and a short 'tuktuk' ride from the spice markets, Hindu temples and Jew Town. ",,tea-bungalow,,"Tea Bungalow in Kochi - Travel in India | Travellers Palm",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Built in the trademark style of tea bungalows, this is raised on stilts. The advantages include being out of the reach of any wandering beasts and also to escaping flood waters of the Brahmaputra when she breaches her banks. In addition, the raised stilts make it easier to mount an elephant!

The bungalows have features typical to homes on tea estates; sloping roofs of green coloured tin sheets, wrap-around verandahs and large handsome rooms with colonial furniture. The views from the verandahs are of the well kept garden on one side and the sprawling tea gardens at the back. 

The two rooms on the upper level are a few notches above the ones downstairs, which surprisingly are priced the same despite the considerable step-down in quality. The upstairs rooms are amazingly large and have a lofty bed to match. A large bathroom/dressing room is attached. With their hardwood floors, inviting beds and period furniture, these two rooms get top marks. 

The service is attentive with a choice of bed-tea and a fresh breakfast served either in the dining room or the verandah, depending on the weather. We chose the bright verandah for our breakfasts and dinners and it was one of the highlights of our stay here.

The first look at the Thengal Manor is unforgettable. Lutyen style columns support the lofty portico. A short flight of steps leads to the front verandah with exquisite flooring of red cement with in-situ patterns. An ideal place to enjoy the front garden is around the large round table with easy chairs around it. A newly created swimming pool right opposite the porch somewhat mars the period feel, although it would be great in the summers. 

The Manor is the family home of a tea-baron, acknowledged as Assam's richest tea grower. And despite being open to select guests, it still serves as the residence of the octogenarian owner. The entire manor is a feast for the eyes; from high ceilings, walls full of family photos, to stately furniture with touches of gilt, carpets and above all, the stunning collection of art. The formal dining room has a golden light cast by chandeliers and wall scones. Dinner is served here on excellent china and gleaming silverware.

The rooms are vast and filled with stuffed sofas and armchairs, carpets and impressive beds. We spent happy hours admiring the various paintings drawings and photographs.  

The gardens of the Thengal Manor are large and meandering. An unusual thing here are the family memorial slabs at the back, including one of the owner, who, God Bless him with many more active years, is still alive! It seems that he has already chosen what he wants to be his memorial slab!

Here at a grassy promontory is the magical resort, Ri Kynjai.

A single enormous log of wood makes up the reception desk. The wooden hand-rail as you go down the steps is also from chunky sections of wood. And in front of you is one of the best views - miles of lake water flanked by tall pine-clad slopes.  

There is one largish central building with wings of cottages to one side. This building has the Reception, a spa, the restaurant and a long verandah facing the lake. 

The cottages are almost as breathtaking as the views that fill the French doors and large windows. Gleaming hardwood floors with colourful rugs, a fireplace, a few comfortable armchairs with footstools and an extra large bed with handmade bedspread! There is also a loft here where a child can sleep. 

A dressing room with deep wardrobes open into the bathroom with its generous sized Jacuzzi and a separate shower area. The balcony in the front has a dazzling view and some more comfortable chairs. Below us were landscaped slopes going down towards the lake. 

The more economical rooms here are just slightly smaller than the cottages, but come minus the loft, dressing room and the Jacuzzi. Our advice would be to splurge a bit and go for one of the cottages. 

The restaurant serves a good variety of food. On a negative note though, the resort is open to non-residents and especially over a weekend seems to draw many noisy families for lunch and dinner. The service was polite if strained due to the number of guests. We would strongly suggest that you order your food through room service and eat there.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For the very up-scale clientele, the arrival of Diphlu Lodge is a wonderful addition. Arriving at a non-descript gateway, you would have no idea what waits you. 

The rustic-luxurious bamboo-and-thatch cottages of the lodge blend perfectly with the forests. The cottages, made stand on tall stilts around an open area where the resort maintains an actual paddy field. The ambience therefore is totally Thai or Balinese. A charming if slightly shaky low bamboo bridge is the walkway in the resort. Walking over the paddy field in this manner is a lovely experience. 

The Diphlu river runs just meters away from the resort and most cottages offer a good view of the river. The cottages are buff coloured, merging well into the greenery and earthy environment. Inside, the vernacular architecture provides just about every modern amenity one can want; deep mattresses and quality linen, a fridge (with a cane cabinet cover), cozy sofas and best of all, sit-outs on either side. 

The bathroom is a visual delight with glass walls and a thatch cover, a very Balinese affair. A note of caution here is to be careful about slipping. The tiles are a bit on the slippery side and the glass is not of the toughened variety. So, guests are cautioned to be extra careful here. 

The best feature of the resort though, is the common lounge, which is the only tall structure. Built with an abundance of bamboo, hardwood with planters' chairs placed strategically to give the best of river view, the lounge is a sheer delight. Guests can luxuriate on the deep sofas after a morning of bumping around in jeeps on elephant back. There is a well stocked bar, the best we came across in Assam.

You can relax on the verandah of your houseboat overlooking the serene Nageen Lake and the mountains beyond.",,,,,,,,,,12:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Staying on a houseboat in Srinagar is a unique, must-do experience. The houseboats generally have three or four bedrooms, each with attached bathroom, electricity and modern plumbing. There is a common dining and lounge area, as well as a balcony at the front facing the lake. Quite a few houseboats have rooftops that are accessible. Some have gardens. These additional areas are appealing as they provide more space for guests. There is also a small kitchen, where the ""boat captain"" assigned to each houseboat is usually found, especially at meal times, when large numbers of local dishes will be served to you. 

The famous Dal Lake is where the majority of the houseboats are located. However, it's also crowded and commercial and in some areas the houseboats are unattractively lined up bumper to bumper along a canal. On the other hand, Nigin Lake is much smaller, quieter, and more picturesque. So we use houseboats which are located on Nagin Lake.

Unlike houseboats in Kerala, these houseboats don't move. They're permanently docked on the lake. Houseboats docked lengthways along the lake will usually offer lake views from their bedrooms. Otherwise bedrooms will have a view of the neighboring houseboat but their balconies will be fronting the lake.

The famous Kashmir Houseboats originated during the period of the British Raj. Kashmir's ruler would not allow the British (who were as fond of Kasmir's cool climate as the Mughals) to own land in his kingdom. So they adopted the solution of building houseboats as a compromise - each one a little bit of England, afloat on Srinagar's lakes.

The houseboats soon evolved from modest floating homes to veritable floating palaces. They now range from 60 to 150 ft. long, are 15 to 20 ft. wide and each is unique. The cedar interiors are intricately carved and display the consummate artistry of Kashmiri craftsmen. The furnishings include embroidered native rugs and fabrics, local objects d'art, and solidly comfortable Victorian and Edwardian furniture. This is a reminder of times gone by, and there is no better way to experience the reflective atmosphere and tranquility inspired by the nearby Himalayas than from the traditional and spacious home comforts of your very own houseboat.

The best way to experience the life of Nageen Lake is from one of the hand rowed boats, known as Shikaras, which are constantly seen transporting both people, local produce, and all sorts of goods, around the lake. The boatman will take you beyond the lake and into the small canals which thread their way through the vegetable and flower gardens where you will witness the unusual practice of farming on the water, as well as fishermen and plenty of birdlife. It is an extraordinarily tranquil, and colourful, scene, mostly unchanged for centuries, and is a highlight of any visit to Srinagar.

Folklore has it that the sons of the Kadathanadu rulers were sent to Calicut to be educated in institutions set up by the Zamorin of Calicut, and hence a city house was built for the young princes.

Doctor couple, Srikumar and Neeta Srikumar are the inheritors of the royal residence that was purchased by Neeta's grandfather in 1960. It was only in 2000 that the neurologist decided to rescue the dilapidated property from ruin and convert it into a heritage resort. The original structure was kept intact, the massive doors and windows made of Irul and Jackfruit wood were retained and some panels from the windows were replaced with glass for more light and ventilation.

The anterooms of the main bedrooms were converted into bathrooms with all modern amenities. The low roof of the kitchen was dismantled and the first floor was eliminated to create a high ceiling for the new kitchen. The lawns were painstakingly manicured and landscaped. 

Also dotting the backyard is a selection of ayurvedic plants and herbs. Because, while Harivihar functions as a heritage resort,  its mainstay is Ayurveda. Guests can avail of treatments under the supervision of Dr Mali and Dr Ramakrishnan, famed Ayurvedic practitioners of the region. Harivihar has also been awarded the Green Leaf accredition by the Kerala tourism department-the only facility in Kerala in its class to have been awarded this honour. 

The day begins very simply at Harivihar. Wake up to the sound of chirping birds at your window, go in for a session of Yoga. Then choose between a Pancha Karmam or Shodhanam-a five step purification treatment for the body. Special treatment for longer durations include Shiro Dhara, Pizhichil, Navarakkizhi, Shirovasti and Kizhi.

Long since abandoned, the trees and vegetation continued to thrive due to a reliable source of underground water. The resort is very much a modern day Mughal Palace, conceived in the present, but paying homage to the architecture and design of Indias golden age.

Air-conditioning is very effective for warm days, or you can enjoy fresh air on the deck chairs in the veradah - ideal for sunbathing and watching Blackbucks. 

The bathrooms are big too, with a tub and shower. There is a separate shower open-to-the-sky too; it's fun, and no one can see you! Surprisingly, each cottage has a flat screen television set connected to a dish for clear reception. There are facilities to make your tea / coffee in the room.

The park gates are about half a mile away, but you don't even need to go there all the time when Nature's creations come to you in your lodge anyway. The back door of the cottage leads straight on to your very own terrace with cushioned teak chairs from which you can survey the surroundings and wait for blackbuck, nilgai and birdlife to turn up for a drink. 

You can go for safaris in your own car, or book one in the lodge's old Wiley jeeps. Other amenities include a library with comfortable sofas and a dining where you can request cuisines of your choice.

Meals are made using fresh ingredients, taste good and served in fine crockery. There are no other eating options around, but you will not have reasons to complain here.

The Rhaza Pru has about 8-10 guest rooms, all comfortable but fairly spartan.

But it is the charm of this historic ""cottage"", the taste with which its decoration has been carried out, the appeal of its hill-side location and the availability of terrace and garden, that make it such a happy surprise in Kohima. The staff are endlessly willing and kind, and the owners attentive to guest needs. The hotel aims to be a second home for visitors and succeeds.

The quaint mud and jute restaurant serves great meals. At night you can enjoy a bonfire and barbeque dinner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A rustic jungle lodge in a recently opened national park gives you to perfect opportunity to feel like a pioneer explorer into the jungles of Pench National Park. The log huts and other structures of the camp have been constructed using local materials and traditional wisdom, such as using dry reed for roofing that helps regulate the extremes of temperature the park experiences and mud to build the dining area.

Rather than creating an environment so polished as to make you forget your proximity to the wild, at Tribal Camp you are encouraged to remember the wildlife that you are here to experience. Yet, modern conveniences like air coolers in the summer, hot and cold running water and attached bathrooms have been provided. The food has often been appreciated by guests for its 'made at home' flavour.

Perhaps, the most important aspect of any jungle lodge is the quality of the jungle guides. At Tribal Camp the owners are so actively involved as to accompany some jeep safaris and consciously use guides with in-depth local knowledge, often employed from the local tribal communities.

You'll probably want to make a couple of jeep safaris into Pench National Park simply in order to do justice to the wealth of wildlife and landscapes it offers: leopards and tigers, mouse deer and spotted deer, monitor lizards and marsh crocodiles, numerous water birds drawn to the waters of the Pench River and the many artificial water bodies and, of course, the unique landscape of teak forests.",,tribal-camp-pench,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But, like anywhere, the thing that turns a building from a house into a home are the people and the staff and owners of Baruah Bhawan are known for their unflagging generous hospitality.  

The present owner, Mr Raj Baruah, is often on the premises and has an long and respected career in the Merchant Navy. He was also, at one time, in charge of the Government of Assam's fleet of river vessels. Son of Dr Birnichi Baruah who founded the Guwahati University and the Assam Academy for Cultural Relations, any conversation with him is likely to enrich your understanding and knowledge of the state of Assam.
