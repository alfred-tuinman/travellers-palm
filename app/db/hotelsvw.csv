The lake here, around which the whole town revolves, is considered to ne extremely holy and a bath here is second only to one in the Ganges at Varanasi. Hundreds of small temples are built on the periphery of the lake. Well designed, wide stone steps lead down to the lake. These are called the `ghats'. Devotees come to worship at the temples and on the ghats early every morning and at sunset too. Prayers and chanted, hymns are sung, and devotional music is played at the temples.

Pushkar is also known for its annual ""Camel Fair"". Traditionally, when devotees would come on a pilgrimage at the time of the first full moon of the Hindu year, they would bring along their cattle, camels and brisk trade would take place. It is now one of the largest fairs of its kind and attracts thousands of people. This is a fantastic opportunity to see people in traditional, ceremonial attire, entire families having travelled considerable distance to attend the fair. The various animals are displayed in their finery and there are competitions and races too. 

Pushkar Palace is one of the oldest hotels in Pushkar and is located right on the banks of the lake. Until recently, the hotel had a fabulous sunset terrace with well tended palm trees and other mature trees. A zealous town council decreed that the garden was violating the public space and tore it down. Minus the terrace, the Pushkar Palace still has lovely views from the suites which are right next to the lake and from the upper floors of the main wing. A small garden is in the centre and this is a delightful place to sit and relax.

While the best rooms are in the main house their popularity ensures that they are quite often unavailable.

The more modern rooms in the annexe are less imaginatively decorated but are still large and cool, with large beds covered in hand block printed quilts, with creamy walls, chintz covered sofas and leafy plants. There are also paintings of flowers and peacocks on the doors and cupboards.   

There is no air conditioning in the rooms (this is an environmentally friendly hotel after all) but the overhead fans circulate the breeze that comes in through the large windows. There is a charming blue floored library in the main building, with a cushioned window seat to curl up in, a dozen lounge chairs, and cane chairs in the garden.

Its creator, Manju Barua, a big bear of a man is a true character with a vast repertoire of local knowledge. The naturalists at Wild Grass are decidedly the best and a true wildlife enthusiast is well advised to make this a base in Kaziranga. 

The resort is located on a large piece of land, shaded by old trees and flowering vines. The central building is vibrantly brick red coloured, and has a large dining area, which forms the main hub for gathering. There is a cozy sit-out here, a perfect spot for relaxing and post lunch or dinner tea/coffee. 

The rooms are located in two separate blocks of 9 each. Although the blocks are tall, they are well concealed under the trees. The rooms, although certainly not luxurious are charming. They all have hardwood floors, an armchair or two and comfortable beds. The bathrooms, which were possibly very modern when the resort was built, are adequate now. The management informs that they will be re-doing them soon.   

At Wild Grass the emphasis is very much on the environment and wildlife, and that is reflected in the high quality naturalists. The staff of Wild Grass all hail from Kaziranga, and the surrounding villages and this gives them an excellent combination of local knowledge and academic expertise.

Even within the compound, trees are well signposted with their botanical and common names for identification. Over two hundred species of birds have been recorded in the vicinity of the lodge. During our stay at Kaziranga, we regularly saw a pair of Scops Owl, Red Vented Bulbuls and many other birds.

The bathrooms have western toilets and hot and cold showers. 

Local food specialties are served on low tables surrounded by comfortable mud sofas with the same mirror and leaf patterns. 

But most of the life at Desert Coursers is lived outdoors, on jeep safaris following the Indian Wild Ass (found only here), and flamingoes in the wintertime as they seek warmer weather for breeding. Dhanraj's wildlife expertise is well known and has been solicited by the likes of the BBC and the National Geographic Society.

There is an entrance courtyard, large enough for camels and elephants carrying royal guests. 

The reception and bar are in the front verandah, bathed in a delicate glow from the bright coloured chic blinds. Well padded cane chairs around marble tables make a good vantage point to watch the activity. Inside is a handsome, high ceilinged family drawing room with an impressive collection of armour and portraits of family members. Do not miss the frescoes and other Raj memorabilia.

The castle with its outlying wings offers many rooms. There are some in the main castle building while others are in the new wings which blend harmoniously with the old structure. All rooms are spacious and have excellent en-suite facilities with grand old style furniture. The fabrics used are of good quality cotton with hand-block print from Rajasthan. Most rooms have a cosy seating area and also access to a verandah.

Castle Mandawa has a lovely swimming pool and also offers spa facilities, a pool and billiards table, and a table tennis table. 

Breakfast and lunch is generally served in the indoor dining room which is decorated with richly painted frescoes.

The final stretch leads through the cobbled stone streets of the Samode village to an enormous arched gateway. Then you come face to face with the Palace. 

The first sight of the palace is spectacular. Climbing the impressive flight of steps gives you enough time to admire the building. An amazing number of windows and carved friezes face you. From inside another pair of gates, the inner courtyards unfold. 

Samode Palace consists of a succession of courtyards, each with a different mood. Note the flowering creepers, flaming bougainvillea, stately palms, brass pots holding smaller palms, and large marble tubs decorated with floating petals. The overall impression is of contained luxury and sophistication. 

The rooms at Samode Palace are in wings accessed via the various courtyards. They are all decorated in a style that can be described as Royal Rajput meets western sophistication. Paisley prints, re-interpreted motifs in smooth cottons, tasteful durries on the floors, colourful bed covers and curtains, and extremely comfortable mattresses. The spacious bathrooms are some of the best in India with premium quality fixtures and fittings, and even have separate shower cubicles.

The suites, and in particular the Royal suites, are extraordinarily beautiful. The Royal Suites have private terraces overlooking the hillside and an oudoor Jacuzzi to enjoy the views. If there is one place where you should splurge, this is it. 

There are also public areas of immense beauty such as the Sultan Mahal, the Sheesh Mahal and the grandest one of them all, the Durbar Hall, acknowledged to have the finest examples of Shekhavati style frescoes.  The Durbar Hall is literally painted all the way to its lofty ceilings. High fanlights let in natural light giving the room a glow that is unparalleled. 

The artistically designed pool is to one side, as is an air-conditioned restaurant. Food can be served in the main dining hall, around the pool deck, or in the central courtyard.  Romantic dinners can be arranged at many of the secluded locations and terraces.

In keeping with the beautiful natural surroundings, recreational and leisure facilities include a health complex by the pool comprising a fully equipped fitness centre, sauna, steam and changing rooms. The emphasis has been placed on creating a quiet and relaxed atmosphere. There is also a Kerala Ayurvedic Centre (famous world over for the herbal oil massages). 

A note of caution would be that if you have mobility problems or are disabled, then this palace is probably not for you as there are no lifts and no wheelchair ramps due to the historical nature of the building.",,samode-palace,"A fairytale palace nestled picturesquely amid rugged hills.

This trend has turned out to be the saviour of many old houses which would otherwise have been condemned to the scrapyard to make way for modern concrete houses. 

The charm of the resort is obvious immediately on arrival by boat, pulling up right in front of the reception. The reception itself is a small wooden pavilion with a small open courtyard in the centre. The resort spreads over a large area, surrounded by all sides by water - lake Vembanad on one side, and canals feeding it on the others. Small canals also  run through the property and are crossed by pretty bridges. 

The guest rooms are all in cottages, either individual or in clusters. Each one has a different charm but all have common features such as wooden walls, terracotta flooring, antique furniture, and modern open-to-the sky bathrooms. Each room has a sit-out to enjoy the peaceful, verdant surroundings.  

The meals are served buffet-style and are sumptuous. Most dishes are prepared with organic produce and there are always several authentic Kerala delicacies to sample.

The rooms tend to be of the gleaming, dark wood furniture and chintzy curtains variety. They are very generously sized, with large, king sized beds, rich upholstery on period chairs and reddish brown wood floors. 

Some rooms are housed in yellow cottages separate from the main building. Although younger in age, the rooms here continue with the English country cottage theme - peach and pistachio green walls, and metal canopy beds. The overall effect is regal, yet still very warm and inviting.

There are a number of common areas and restaurants to choose from. The Tiger Lounge is really a stylish boys' den. Tiger trophies from various erstwhile princely states adorn the walls. The glassed multi-cuisine restaurant has been designed to take full advantage of the views over the bamboos and tall deodar trees that surround it. The more formal dining room area, the Imperial Banquet Room, is presided over by a buffalo head trophy and serves special Himachali cuisine on request.  

The atmospheric Hollywood Bar has black and white chequered floors and rows of autographed monochromatic photographs of Hollywood stars.

Situated at one end of the long, traffic free, Mall road, there are pleasant walks along tree shaded paths to the market areas with their local and international shops.",,woodville-palace,"An elegant, old-fashioned 1930s mansion on the peaceful western side of Shimla, with huge rooms, period furniture, lawns and a badminton court. ","Woodville Palace in Shimla - Travel in India | Travellers Palm","woodville palace, shimla, heritage, hotel, himachal pradesh, special places","Woodville Palace","Raj Bhawan Road

Later we were astounded to see the nearby City Palace, a stunning place which is still the private property of the royal family. Complete with painted durbar hall, a myriad of terraces, balconies, pavilions and grand rooms, the City Palace is an absolute treasure trove of architecture. 

Under the British rule, Karauli was a state worthy of a 17 gun salute! As a result, there were many occasions of state visits and hunting parties. The formal drawing room of the Palace is full of family memorabilia from that era. 

The meals are served in the family dining area - the kitchen is just behind and is the same one which caters to the Royal family. His Highness, Krishna Chandra Pal is often in residence, and guests may well find him seated next to them at dinner-time. 

When we first visited the Bhanwar Vilas Palace in the late 1980s, there were just 4 bedrooms in the main building, all large and gracious with a lot of old word charm.

Udaipur was built by the Mewar ruler Udai Singh to replace his old capital of Chittaurgarh after it was conquered by the Mughals in 1568. The royal family still occupies a section of the immense City Palace complex which also houses a Museum and the Shiv Niwas and Fateh Prakash hotels. From here you have fabulous views over Lake Pichola and the famous Lake Palace Hotel on Jag Niwas Island.

The Bazaar
The Udaipur area is famous for its miniature paintings and during a walk through the bazaar, you will see many artists' studios and shops. Udaipur was also an important centre for other arts like pottery, sculpture etc. The Shilpagram is an arts and crafts complex a short drive away from the town and well worth a visit.

A sunset trip on the Lake, is a beautiful way of admiring the multitude of its white palaces. The lakeside is always full of life; with evening prayers going on in the many temples, people washing doing their laundry, vehicles crossing the narrow bridges - there is not a minute of boredom. With the sunset, the lake changes colours rapidly, going from a deep blue to red-gold. As darkness descends, a million lights go up around the lake, turning it into another chimera. The entire city palace complex is floodlit, turning it into deep golden colour.

Back then, the lodge was in a sadly neglected state, but one could see the potential. Over the next few years, Swaroop Singh restored the lodge into an exceptionally enjoyable hideaway. 

The work he started was continued after his death by his two dynamic and talented sons. Touches of modern chic were introduced by the young head of the family, Raghuveer Singh Rathore. He is a designer, celebrated for his use of a mix of Indian and Western styles.

The garden within the fortress-like walls has green lawns, day-beds draped in white muslin and small statues hidden here and there.

With this aim it was built close to the Machchu River so that cool winds would blow over it, and this is the reason why it also features a 3 storey step well complete with sculptures and carvings of both Indian and Greco-Roman gods. The faded yellow and white of this 19th century building is enlivened by the Art Deco colours and designs that decorate its interiors. 

The grounds of the Royal Oasis are large with shade giving trees and slightly unkempt lawns. The main building sits in the centre of these with a colonial style arched gateway with a garden of marble benches and statues to match. 

The rooms have dark wood floors and light pastel coloured walls, with the beds and furniture belonging firmly to the Art Deco period. The bathrooms are modern but still quaintly 1940's. There are 2 suites in the Royal Oasis - the Queen's Room and the King's Rooms. Both evoke a sense of faded grandeur as a result of the slightly moth eaten leopard skins on the floor and their shiny cerulean blue cupboards, and a sense of the utterly bizarre because of the bathrooms that are made entirely from mirrored and coloured black glass. 

Dinner is served in a room surrounded by photos of the royal family and speckled green walls to match the dining table and chairs. Dinner is an elaborate affair with a fixed menu involving Indian vegetarian and meat dishes. 

The most fascinating feature of the Royal Oasis is surely the step well or ""vaav"" which is a mixture of Hindu, Islamic, Gothic and Art Deco architecture, and is housed in a separate building. The scarcity of water in the state of Gujarat was responsible for the popularity of step wells and while you are likely to see a few different varieties of them, this one is quite likely to be the most memorable, inspite of its slightly green and murky water. Its floral arches, inlaid stone work and carved stone ""chatri"" cenotaphs are delightful.",,royal-oasis,"Located in lush green gardens, the summer palace of the Maharaja of Wankaner is a true Art Deco bungalow.

The rooms are distributed on the 3 floors of the palace and each room has large canopied brass four poster beds covered in brightly coloured Indian bed linen, a sitting area and well sized bathrooms with modern fittings. Most rooms have direct access to the wide porches lined with a mixture of cane chairs and original Chippendale tables. 

The palace was furnished to suit the taste of a young Rajput Crown Prince. Hence the many hunting trophies of tiger skins and mounted blackbuck, lion and deer heads. The sitting room, also called the India Room, features brass work and samples of traditional Kutchi beadwork. 

Meals are prepared by the excellent royal chef and served in the formal dining room in the palace which has restored Elizabethan china cabinets filled with gilded porcelain bric-a-brac.

The river has rapids graded from 1 to 4 (as per the grading below), intersterced with placid stretches where one can even body surf in the gentle waves. Each raft is steered by a qualified rafting guide who is there to ensure your safety.  No risks are taken and if the guide determinse that certain sections of the river are not suitable for rafting, their decision is final.

Grade I - Relaxing - Waves are so small you may not even get wet.
Grade II - Easy does it - Clear passages and moderate waves.
Grade III - Adventurous - Lots of waterslide like waves, short rapids with clean passages. Excellent family adventure!
Grade IV - Thrilling - Long rapids, powerful waves.

726,"One of the most exclusive palace hotels in India, spread over regal grounds of the magnificent City Palace complex, Shiv Niwas makes for a majestic stay. 

Formerly the Maharana's guest quarters, this restored historic hotel offers ornate architecture, romantic terraces and a lovely swimming pool set in the courtyard under old trees. 

Part of the magnificent City Palace complex, its original ornamentation is splendidly preserved. 

The fabulous suites offer the best accommodation in Udaipur.

The Shiv Niwas Palace, a half moon shaped building was built as a royal guest house. Built around a marble lined swimming pool, a lofty platform/verandah takes you to the lake facing rooms. 

The menu is fairly eclectic with a choice of Indian and western dishes. Food can be served on the poolside terrace or guests have a choice of dining in the restaurants of the next door Fateh Prakash hotel or the open air sunset terrace overlooking the lake below.  

The exclusive suites are located just off the swimming pool. A profusion of crystal, glass inlay work and seductive coloured chandeliers above awaits the guest.  Delicate platforms, raised a small height house windows, give views over parts of the lake and of Sajjan Niwas gardens, the royal gardens beyond.  One can imagine the dignitaries around the world having been entertained in a style that only the very rich of the Indian royalty could offer.

Do try and look carefully at the single coloured glass inset in plaster. Deep, jewel-like tones are rich and glowing. This is the similar type of work that you can see in the bar of the Lake Palace - a property that also belongs to the royal house of Udaipur. 

Besides the suites, there are a number of `Palace Rooms' which are towards the back of the Shiv Niwas. These rooms are comfortable, overlook the gardens and the elegant driveway and have their own private sit-outs. These are comfortable but the `palace feel' is faint!

Any of the traditionally attired service staff will be delighted to show you where Octopussy, the James Bond extravaganza was filmed. 

A dapper Roger Moore, starts his chase of the bad guys starting from the Shiv Niwas swimming pool; of all the things giving the chase in autorickshaw through the narrow bazaar lanes of Udaipur!

Traditional craftsmen were employed in this ambitious project and they also created pillars, latticework wall pieces and corbelling to match the old style to the smallest detail. The result is a remarkable building. 

Jagat Palace has possibly the largest stone entrance arch after the Buland Darwaza of Fatehpur Sikri. Buff coloured walls offset the deep red of the stone. The carvings are intricate in some cases, the sheer size is awe inspiring. 

Inside the building the entrance lobby is grand and supported by oversized pillars decorated with colourful murals. The dining room is another grand room. Being in Pushkar, the hotel only serves vegetarian food, but it has a large choice of Indian and western dishes, with the traditional thali lunches and dinners being especially popular. 

The Place has two identical wings, with a very pleasant garden courtyard in between. The gardens are laid out in a formal, symmetrical style with many trees which are rare in Rajasthan. Small carved pavilions with swings and colonial furniture make inviting nooks and crannies for relaxing. Behind the hotel buildings is a large swimming pool with a spacious deck. 

The rooms are neatly divided by a narrow well of a courtyard. They are airconditioned and also provide heating in winters. Ceilings have traditional borders hand painted around the ceilings and floors are laid with marble. Jagat Singh is a collector of antiques, especially from the colonial times, and he has used some wonderful pieces to furnish the rooms, including beds with carved headboards or four posters. The bedside tables are often delicately carved, inset with hand painted glazed tiles.",,jagat-palace,"A newly built `palace' which makes use of rescued carvings and has amazing stone work.

The Kohinoor Hotel as all other hotels in Diu, caters mainly to the Gujarati families that crowd its beaches on weekends and so the hotel offers such recreational facilities like a discotheque and bar, a Jacuzzi, and indoor and outdoor games. Their Ayurvedic Centre even offers special packages for treatments lasting from 40 minutes to 21 days.

Originally built to house the guests of the Maharaja of Gondal, this is now a small hotel with airy, elegant rooms decorated in the best of the 1930's and 40's Art Deco style. 

Fine Mughal tapestries, paintings of harriers and waders, and prints of Indian masterpieces from the personal collection of the royal family of Gondal line the walls. However, this vast collection of memorabilia does not become overpowering because of the large size of the rooms and their 15 foot high ceilings. The furniture is beautifully polished and preserved. The dominant Art Deco style is interspersed with older pieces of period furniture. 

At the back of the garden is the beautifully restored Rail Saloon of the royal family. This lilac and white carriage sits on rails next to a mock railway platform. Inside is a drawing room, a dining section, a bedroom and 2 bathrooms. Complete with its original fittings, dark inlaid wood and chintz sofas, this 1907 saloon is an utter delight. 

The vast property also includes the royal family's present home and the impressive collection of classic and vintage cars belonging to the royal family, including a Formula 5000 from 1972, a couple of classic Studebakers, and several Rolls Royces.

The Palace offers a wide variety of places to lounge in, such as the garden inhabited by peacocks, the broad verandahs of the palace, or the relaxing floor cushions of the upper salon.",,orchard-palace,"A lovely palace with just seven guest rooms, set in a huge complex of fruit orchards, lawns and gardens.

A benevolent Ganesh statue greets you in the cool lobby. There is comfortable seating here with colourful cushions in a cozy fireside lounge. To the side is the restaurant/dining area.

The rooms come in different categories but are all in cottages spread in the lush plantation garden. Each room has a different charm. The honeymoon cottages have romantic rose lighting, and chic black rough stone bathrooms with stylish fittings. Coloured fabrics are used to bring out the dark wood or white walls. All rooms have a sit-out from where you can enjoy the gardens. The whole place has a great sense of style and panache.

There is a fair-sized pool with a small deck where dinner can be served on request. Close by, is a pavilion which serves as a reading/television lounge with deep comfortable chairs and sofas. There is an Ayurveda centre with excellent massages on offer.

Built in the cool shadows of the Dhauladhar mountains to be the summer residence of a Nawab, the Taragarh Palace was later acquired for the dowager Queen of Jammu and Kashmir. 

For all its illustrious history, the Palace hotel is a fairly modern establishment with a seasonal swimming pool, exercise facilities, and telephones and televisions in each of its grandly furnished room.   

The newer wing is a sturdy, red brick building. Less graceful than the original building, this is a low bungalow with a painted wooden facade and filigree like fretwork. However as alluring as it is to stroll through the tiger skin lined corridors of the heritage wing, it is the rooms in the modern wing that are surprisingly the more appealing. Larger and sunnier, these rooms have queen sized, 2 poster beds, cool marble patterned floors and brick fireplaces. The bathrooms are equally elegant and modern, some even have marble bathtubs.

The dining area is a large, exposed brick affair with charming wood and brass ceiling fans and large figurines of deer on the long tables, designed for formal dining.
 
Outside on their lawns are benches under trees and canopies, a cordoned off section for the prized polo ponies and a pool behind the green roofed heritage wing.

A road climbs past thick bushes of fuchsia pink bougainvillea and up to the serene villas of the Gateway hotel perched on Pasumalai Hill. Built in 1890 to house the owner of a textile company, the villas sit at a sedate distance from each other. Although rooms have been added on to the original structure, they have retained the country style terracotta floors, dainty fretwork and red rooves of the older buildings. The turn-of-the-century grace of the building and the rolling lawns are reminiscent of the days of the Raj.
 
The colonial era rooms are generously sized with light wood floors and sometimes large French windows. The furniture leans towards the classical style, covered with heavy brocade and chintz in brown and gold tones. Carnations and rose petals floating in bowls give a splash of red to the black and white bathrooms. 

The open air barbeque restaurant commands a birds' eye view of the city, while the indoor restaurant offers a range of cuisines. Peacocks roam the terraced gardens.

The result was the impressive Lallgarh Palace.

The opulent Lallgarh Palace draws its inspiration largely from the Rajput tradition. Its facade, like a Rajput fort, has almost no decorative features, except its topping of arrayed cupolas. But there is also a strong touch of the Renaissance in the way the palace has been laid out, with its collonades and corridors. 

Bikaner's royal family produced many statesmen who regularly met with India's British rulers. As a result, Lallgarh Palace saw the maximum number of visiting dignitaries from British India. Walking through the broad corridors flanked by a long colonnade of elegant pillars, it is easy to imagine those days. The public chambers such as the dining hall, the drawing room, the library and the bar, are large and furnished in a heavy masculine, royal style.

The central courtyard and the expansive gardens soften the austere feel. There is a tennis court, croquet grounds, billiards table and much more. Even if you are not inclined towards sports, the grounds are most pleasant for walks and ambling. Lallgarh Palace also has an interesting in-house museum which tells the colourful history of Bikaner and Rajasthan. There is an indoor pool that is as grand as its surroundings - with double height ceilings and arched windows.",,hotel-lallgarh-palace,"This huge red sandstone Maharaja's palace was constructed in the beginning of the 20th century and is a perfect example of Indo Saracenic architecture. ","Hotel Lallgarh Palace in Bikaner - Travel in India | Travellers Palm","lallgarh palace, bikaner, rajasthan, heritage hotel, special places","Hotel Lallgarh Palace","Lallgarh Complex

The beautifully designed swimming pool borders the lake beyond and has some fabulous carved statues around.  

The palace has a central courtyard with a most unusual structure - Ek Khambiya mahal - a miniature tower intricately carved in deep grey stone with contrasting accents in white marble. This central courtyard gives the palace a totally unique identity. 

The Udai Bilas is an intimate property with only 22 suites and rooms. The overall ambience of the palace and the interiors is of the late Art-Deco period. The suites are extremely large and offer some of the best views of the lake. The standard rooms, in their own wing, are smaller, but they are still charming and comfortable and offer a view of the pool.

Another attraction is the Dungarpur Mews, a 100-years-old heritage building, initially used to stable horses and carriages and then extended to make it a huge garage in the 1930s. The current owner, Harsh Vardhan, has spruced up the old building to showcase some old carriages used in the pre-independence era, some old British cannons, a great collection of vintage cars, a couple of WW1 BMW motorcycles, and even two DH- 5 aicraft!

You enter a different world when you pass the imposing gates of the fort and enter a large courtyard and look up to see a fabulous fort building. Thick walls covered with a mellow beige colour offset the deep red coloured carved stone work on the top. The intricate latticework, and the canopies arching over graceful windows, is breathtaking.
 
The rooms are on two different levels, accessed from a smaller, inner courtyard. The rooms are all very comfortable, freshly painted and spotlessly clean. Classic furniture and colourful local fabrics are used throughout. The bathrooms have been newly installed with modern fitting and have hot and cold running water. You may find old niches converted into soap holders or a bathroom with a domed ceiling, elevating it into a fabulous chamber. 

At the bottom of the fort is one of the most imaginative swimming pools you will come across in Rajasthan. The area around Khejarla is home to pink/grey granite. One such huge granite rock juts out of the earth and now forms one end of a swimming pool. The tiling of the pool is done in white marble, giving the water a delicate aqua tone. 

The Khejarla fort is a delight to explore. The walls are as thick as two metres in places and its many terraces and windows give unexpected views over the countryside. Watch out for details of corbelling, a lone pavilion standing over the small courtyard. At the highest point of the Fort are three domes, topped by delicate finials. These attract jade green parakeets, and sparrows and pigeons nest in the stone walls.",,fort-khejarla,"This impressive fort has recently undergone a total renovation.

From 1986, the ruins of this Fort were sensitively restored and reconstructed into a magnificent Palace hotel.  

An enormous entrance gate leads into the fort. You pass smaller gates, and ascend a stone-paved ramp to the main level of the fort. Here you will find the reception and most of the common areas.  Rooms literally head off in all directions, through various staircases, passageways and terraces. 

The rooms come in all sizes and themes, each with its own descriptive name, and are decorated in an eclectic fashion, with a combination of Rajasthani and colonial furniture and colourful fabrics. There are some exquisite pieces of furniture. Most rooms have access to balconies or terraces which offer superb views. The suites are superb -- our favourites being the Chandra Mahal with its black and white decor, Francisi Mahal with its elegant poster beds, and Kailash Burj with its unusual round shape.

The many superb common areas include various terraces, indoor and outdoor dining venues, lily pools and a swimming pool with a deck. The pool in a secluded location is accessed by a series of steps and winding passages. The pool is built with traditional Rajasthani motifs and small steps built in the style of a step-well go down one side. The deck overlooks the valley and gardens below and is an excellent place to watch the sunset.

Another good place to watch the sunset is the large terrace just past the main entrance, on the lower level. This terrace offers great views not only of the terrace but also a large section of the imposing fort facade with balconies, cupolas and canopied windows. 

Meals are served in different venues, depending on the season. One of the most impressive is an open-air courtyard created by high old walls with partial views through arches and high windows. In winters this area is kept warm by gas torches and heaters. With the French connection, there is generally a French chef looking after the kitchens and the food usually includes some innovative European dishes.",,neemrana-fort-palace,"An impeccably restored 15th century fort.

After reaching the village of Pachewar, the road ends at the massive entrance of the Garh. Enormous gates are supported by walls more than a couple of metres thick. The yellow ochre colour softens the walls and gives a warm welcome. The whole fort area is hidden behind these thick and tall walls. Inside is another world. There is a large lawn interspersed with trees that attract birds. One side has old stables and the other side gives access to the roof tops. 

A smaller gate leads into the second, family courtyard. Inside this, is the small, but charming Durbar Hall, now converted into the main dining hall. This room has some colourful frescoes on the arched ceilings. Breakfast and lunch is served here, while dinner is often eaten around a wood-fire on the paved terrace outside.  

The rooms are spread over the various parts of the Garh, and each has a unique character. Some are large old chambers with arched ceilings and painted frescoes on the walls. Other rooms are smaller but brightly decorated with local furnishings.

Throughout the fort there are open air terraces with fabulous views of the countryside. Sunsets are spectacular here as are moonlit nights. 

An interesting fact about Pachewar Garh is that the force behind it is a Rajput lady, the daughter of the present ruler. Wife of an army major, Madhulika Singh took over the fort and turned it into an aristocratic hostelry.

They believe that the natural beauty of the land is best left as is! Outdoor lighting is restricted to only that necessary for orientation, security and safety, and is directed so as to minimize the disturbance to nocturnal wildlife.

12 years ago Jungle Retreat was a sericulture plantation devoid of trees and vegetation. On their 35 acres, the owners began a regeneration and reforestation program, which continues today; protecting and planting diverse species local to the area. Over a hundred species of birds and a whole herd of spotted deer now delight their visitors. More recently Malabar Giant Squirrels, Flying Squirrels and peacocks have begun to frequent the land. On rare occasions even leopards are seen. 

The swimming pool is built to resemble a watering hole. Besides employing 80% local staff, Jungle Retreat have gone a step further and now run a specialist programme in which they train, and subsequently provide work opportunities to, members of the local community. They learn about the importance of interpretation, being responsible guides, and about nature including ornithology (birds) and herpetology (reptiles).

Upstairs from the dining area is yet another large room which may have been a ball room originally. The combination of the expanse of wooden floors and high ceilings make this a wonderful lounge. Don't miss the traditional wooden swing supported by brass chains from the ceilings!

The main building is an elegantly symmetrical stone building with a sloping roof characteristic of this hilly area. A flight of stone steps in a landscaped garden leads you to the upper level which is a gently undulating plateau. The cottages are scattered here, with enough distance between them to remain private and peaceful. 

Another building here houses the dining room and above this is a lounge cum library. Golden hued wood is used generously; with large pillars supporting the roof. This is very reminiscent of the graceful simplicity of the Shaker style of architecture. The small pantry/kitchen resembles a country cottage and the whole area exudes a warm atmosphere on chilly evenings. 

The food served is of the highest quality - freshly prepared breakfasts with cereals, home grown fruit and warm breads. Dinner is a combination of western and Kerala dishes. Tea and coffee, the staple of this area, is served through the day in a small thatched pavilion in the garden. 

Windermere is very much a working cardamom estate and the air is gently scented with the smell of the spice.

The gurgling of streams and the chirping and hooting of birds is all the company you can expect. 

Located off the main road, and approached by a steep dirt track, Vythiri Resort is located in a dramatic section of the forest. The resort is spread over 150 acres, with its own ravines, streams and plantations. 

A bamboo bridge crosses a small ravine to reach the rooms from the reception area - one one of the many adventurous elements of staying at Vythiri. There are different kinds of rooms, most in cottages and some in tree houses.
 
The age old trees near Vythiri soar high over the smaller ones, their canopies reaching many meters above ground. The tree houses are built on strong platforms resting on the forks in the branches. The access to one of these is an ingenious pulley (operated on the principle of counter-weights) cage! Once in the tree house, you are entirely surrounded by the tree tops. Spending a night there is an unbelievable experience. 

Even if this kind of adventure is not for you, there is plenty to be enjoyed while living closer to terra firma. Every room has a balcony from which you can enjoy the forest which surrounds you. Day and night, the forest is alive with birdsong. Some of the largest butterflies in India can be see here. 

The resort has a good sized pool, a health club, an Ayurveda centre and a restaurant serving Kerala delicacies as well as a choice of Continental cuisine.",,vythiri-resort,"This resort was one of the first to come up in the beautiful Wayanad district of Kerala, famous for its rainforests and plantation at high elevation.","Vythiri Resort in Vythiri - Travel in India | Travellers Palm","vythiri resort, wayanad, kerala, rainforest, tree houses, birds, special places","Vythiri Resort","Lakkidi

Meals can be served in the traditional dining hall inside the palace or in the garden just behind the palace. Breakfast is often served on the verandah overlooking the garden.

Shaded paths in the garden lead to the rooms, in cottage style buildings. Small courtyards and terraces adjoin the rooms, which all offer good views of the garden. The rooms are comfortable and good sized, have spotlessly clean bathrooms and a private sit-out. The furnishings are tasteful and of an old colonial style. 

The restaurant has a small indoor section and a larger seating space on a patio overlooking the fountains in the garden. The food is freshly cooked, and the kitchen is supervised personally by Rambha - the beautiful lady of the house.

You approach the Camel Camp along a dusty desert road until you reach a large fort-like entrance. This grand entrance adds a surreal touch to what is a whimsically luxurious tented camp. The camp is the brainchild of Reggie Singh, grandson of Maharaj Ratan Singh - a royal of Jodhpur, famous for his polo and shikaar exploits.

The camp comprises spacious and luxurious tents furnished with colourful dhurries, solid wooden beds, a dressing table with mirror, and a small luggage rack. The inside fabric of the tents is also printed with traditional motifs, making them cheerful and bright. The bathrooms are imaginative, with stone flooring and a wash basin, toilet, and shower area. Each tent has a small patio in front with easy lounging chairs.

The central covered area has a thatched bar and restaurant. The long bar has informal lounge style chairs on two different levels. The atmosphere is very much like that of a game lodge, with photos from the old hunting days adorning the mud-plastered walls. On the other side is the dining hall which is enclosed by knee high walls. Along a long wall are the buffet and dining tables. On winter nights the many lamps and candles create a warm ambience. 

Nearby, on another level, is the swimming pool - a touch of unashamed luxury in the desert. A simple, thatch covered pavilion offers shade in the blazing afternoons. From this height, there are extensive views over the desert.
 
Around the Camel Camp are some of the highest dunes of the Thar Desert. A camel ride here is an exhilarating experience. You mount camels from the bottom of the dune and return to camp in time for sunset and champagne cocktails by the poolside.","

When Hari Ajwani and Claudia Derain opened Nilaya in the early 90s, they were true pioneers. Until then, no one in Goa had ever thought of building a small hotel in the hills, and not on the beach. Apart from the choice of location away from the beach, Nilaya also broke every stereotype of a `hotel'. It didn't have any of the conventional `must have' features of hotels otherwise found in Goa, such as a large lobby, a reception, 24 hours coffee shop, room service, etc!  

What it did have is rooms hidden away on several levels amongst vast gardens, a swimming pool large enough to hold all the guests at the same time, and a total sense of privacy. Generally, only in-house guests have the access to the property, which perches atop the Arpora hill, with the coastline visible past paddy fields and coconut groves.  

The rooms, named after various natural elements, like earth, fire etc, are designed in Claudia's impeccable if startlingly bold style. Vibrant colours liven up the walls, there are amazing pillars, and even special acoustic chambers for meditation. The furniture is often of wrought iron or wood.  One thing Nilaya was and remains is uniquely original. 

A beautifully designed dining area overlooks the swimming pool and the horizon beyond. There are also tables scattered in the large gardens.",,nilaya-hermitage,"Cutting edge chic on a hill-top.

Each suite has its own private sit-out, a lounge/living area and a spacious bedroom. The furniture and furnishings are specifically made for the particular room. The overall ambience is one of elegance in a country style - no polished marbles or smelly wall to wall carpets here. Arched windows let in plenty of bright sunlight. There is also a complete Ayurveda spa in its own separate area. Underneath is a well equipped gym. 

Sitting out near your own suite either on the terrace or the gardens, you will be amazed at the sheer variety of rare plants interspersed with lily ponds and water bodies.

This is a charming 1760's manor house located in the heart of the French Quarter. Sensitively restored and furnished with French colonial antiques, it captures the period grandeur of a colonial nobleman's mansion.

There are sixteen rooms with colonial furniture such as four-poster beds, planters chairs, dowry chests and large old mirrors filling the high-beamed spaces. Each of the guest rooms - set around an inner courtyard shaded by citrus and neem trees - is themed and named for a former French colony.

Since every effort was made to alter as little as possible of the original structure, the rooms come in a charming range of shapes and sizes, some resemble a cosy loft, some are large and majestic, and others have a private terrace. Each room has been named after French ""possessions"" (Gingy in Tamil Nadu, 'Surate' in Gujarat etc) in India and in their differing decor reflect the flavours of the diverse regions.  

The ceilings are lofty, the beds high and heavily carved, and there are loungers and divans in every room. The walls are either shiny with age or have a delightful mottled effect due to the layers of paint. The bathrooms have been completely modernized but still have charm, with rough stone floors, maybe even an old brass bucket, and with fragrant Neemrana bath products to pamper yourself with.

Apart from the wrought iron tables and chairs arranged in the inner courtyard, food is also served indoors, in a peach room dotted with old French ""cartes"" (maps) of India. The Creole food here refers to a blend of south Indian and French cuisine that the chef has inherited from old Pondy families.",,hotel-de-lorient,"Easily the best accommodation in Pondicherry, the Hotel de l'Orient is a large terracotta pink and white villa at the heart of the town. ","Hotel de Lorient in Pondicherry - Travel in India | Travellers Palm","hotel de l'orient, pondicherry, french, colonial, heritage, neemrana, special places","Hotel de Lorient","17 Rue Romain Rollard",Pondicherry,"605 001",200,"234 3067, 234 3068, 234 6589","222 7829","","",www.neemranahotels.com/pondi/index.html.htm,,"",0413,,929,,337,25,13,1,0,,1,,

The highlight however is the grassy sit out in front of each cottage from where you can enjoy the magnificent view of the feathery conifer tree tops.

Furnished with an eye for beauty and detail, the rooms are plush but understated - creams and beiges, meditation symbols hang in prints on the walls. A wonderful balcony presents high, bird's eye views of the wooded slopes and silvery Ganges below, perfect for breakfast or a romantic dinner. The rooms have walk in closets and tubs to soak in. 
  
Experts are on hand to recommend which of the 79 body and beauty treatments would best achieve the health goals you've set yourself. While the many therapies, yoga and meditation practices and massage techniques may be found elsewhere also, it is in Ananda that there are found all under one roof (albeit at a certain price). Aside from these there is also the large lap pool to relax in and evening entertainment in their amphitheatre. 
  
The chefs at Ananda design menus with not only taste in mind but also the ayurvedic division of body types. But Ananda encourages you not to look at your stay here as a quick fix-it solution to your health concerns. They instead see it as only the first step in a lifestyle change. So chefs at Ananda work from an open kitchen so that you are able to observe the dishes they create and replicate them at home.

Its cottages have unimpeded views of the majestic and sacred Kanchenjunga Mountain. The narrow, stone pathways of the resort are overhung with drooping wildflowers. The hotel is unpretentious but with a rustic charm that seems to belong to the green hills and clean mountain air around it.

Built according to local Sikkimese architecture style that is now rapidly disappearing, the cottages are placed in a line along the upper ridge of the hill, each surrounded by a path of flowers. Each cottage has 2 rooms separate except for the common patio they share in the front of the cottage. 

The cottages have wooden floors and pine wood wainscoting and are decorated with locally crafted cane work. Low windows in the rooms give the feeling of always being outdoors. The bathrooms are serviceable and clean. 

You can relax in the warm comforts of the Dzongri Bar, or pamper your taste buds at the Silver Fir Restaurant where chefs stir up both local and international cuisines. The front lawn is also a great spot to relax in, as it overlooks the town of Pelling and the mountains beyond.",,norbu-ghang-resort,"Norbu Ghang Resort is situated on the western face of a mountainside and is barely a minute's walk away from the quaint little hamlet of Pelling ","Norbu Ghang Resort in Pelling - Travel in India | Travellers Palm","norbu gang resort, hotel, pelling, sikkim, special places","Norbu Ghang Resort","",Pelling,"737 113",200,"250 566, 258 272, 258 245","258 271","","norbughangresort@yahoo.co.in

Plush hand knotted carpets blanket the floors and the beds are covered with Tibetan applique work. The furniture is teak and rosewood but is also painted and carved in the traditional Tibetan way. There is colour everywhere but it is light, pleasing and very beautiful. 

All the paintings, carpets and furniture have been designed and executed by artists belonging to the Norbulingka Institute. All proceeds from Chonor House are given to this institute, which is dedicated to preserving Tibetan culture and arts.
  
Each room has a unique design and theme and the wall art, carpets and other furnishings have been carefully chosen to enhance it. Each room therefore highlights a specific aspect of Tibet and Tibetan life - paintings of tigers, snow leopards, pandas or monkeys may grace the walls, or there could be scenes of nomads from different regions with their livestock. 
  
These well sized, sunny rooms have armchairs or even separate sitting rooms depending on the category. Some special rooms even have carved and painted altars and carpet covered sofa loungers.
  
The common areas are equally alluring. The Dzipak Parlour has a floor length silk Roman curtain with painstaking applique work depicting richly coloured jewels and the 8 auspicious symbols. There is an outdoor cafe overlooking the hillside where you can listen to the relaxing boom of drums from the nearby Namgyal monastery.

The rustic villas sit well away from each other and house a world of comfort within. Their earthy coloured walls and fat white balustrades shelter many a lounge chair, fluffy white beds, and traditional dark wood cupboards. They are just a stone's throw away from one of the most beautiful beaches in Goa.

",,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The villas have been charmingly named for their original purposes. The piggery, for example, was used to house livestock and the priest lived in his villa well into the 1950's. But they were lovingly and stylishly restored by Denzil Sequeira, the great grandson of the original owner, who is a prominent fashion photographer in Mumbai. 

His artist's eye is clearly seen in bold use of colours like ochre, deep rust and blazing white and the precise placement of Goan curios such as enamel cookware, hand woven baskets and metal pots. But Denzil's deep affection for Elsewhere would not allow him to make any changes to the real essence of his ancestral home. And the result is a preservation of the traditional Goan architectural elements of the house - the tiled roofs, the laterite and mud walls, and the broad verandahs that instantly invite you to sit down and enjoy the sea breeze.

At Elsewhere, modern world comes to a halt and is firmly kept away by the wooden walkway bridge which is the lone access to the villas - no television sets, no ringing telephones and no cars. Just gently swaying palm trees and the warm sea which is a stone's throw away.  Here, only the essential, the restorative and the nostalgic are allowed in.",,elsewhere,"A slim slice of pure paradise, the Elsewhere villas - the Captain's House, the Piggery, the Bakery and the Priest's House, straddle a narrow piece of land between the sea and a creek. ","Elsewhere in Goa - Travel in India | Travellers Palm","elsewhere, beach, villa, ashvem, mandrem, goa, special places, hotel",Elsewhere,"Near Ashvem Beach

The jungle lodge is situated close to the core area of the park in a large private forest. The lodge has seven simply furnished rooms and a garden where meals are often served around a bonfire. 

",,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The only viable accommodation option for exploring the Tadoba Tiger Reserve, Tiger Trails Jungle Lodge consists of 2 standalone cottages with 7 rooms. The rooms are in fact located inside the core area of the park making it a unique accommodation experience. Tigertrails has its own fleet of safari vehicles and also has many machans (watchtowers) on its private land from where one can observe wildlife.

Amrut Dhanwatay, the man behind Tiger Trails and the one responsible for reviving the many acres of previously over-grazed land around his property, is an Environmental Engineer and has been conferred the title of Honorary Wildlife Warden by the state government.  

The rooms, in keeping with most nature lodges, are fairly simple, but they are large and extremely clean and comfortable. The orange ceramic tiles on the floor are warm, the beds adequate and the bathrooms well appointed. There is running hot water but no air conditioning. None is required however as even in the winter months the surrounding forest keeps the temperature pleasant.

Since all meals are included and the fresh air of the surroundings tends to improve the appetite, the owners have wisely decided on providing food which is as close as possible to the light, non greasy food of Indian homes. Buffets are of the local food of the region - lightly spiced, utterly delicious and not often served in restaurants. The ingredients are more than likely to have been grown in the owner's own fields and the results are a delight. 

A definite highlight of the stay is also speaking with and learning from Amrut and his son Aditya, on their efforts to salvage the forest, educate the local people on their role in wildlife conservation, and their desire to support the surrounding villagers. One of them will accompany you on the park rides. Guests often find themselves chatting with the hosts well in to the night around the crackling bonfire that welcomes you back from the afternoon safari.",,tigertrails,"Tigertrails is a private jungle lodge run by Amrut Dhanwatay and his son Aditya.

There are superb views over the river from the terraces of the hotel, especially at sunrise, the most auspicious time to worship the holy river, and at sunset, when an ""aarti"" ceremony is held.

There are 14 rooms, each individually furnished with traditional decorative items. All are bright, welcoming and comfortable, with modern bathrooms. Many have attractive verandahs outside for relaxation.

Books and pamphlets concerning the history, art and culture of Varanasi are found throughout the property, and the friendly owners can be seen attending to the various religious shrines, and are happy to spend time discussing the religious and cultural aspects of this most fascinating, and often confusing, city. As a result the hotel is very popular with those wishing to gain a more in depth understanding of Hinduism, and has been host to many artists, scholars, poets, writers, musicians and philosophers. 

The dining room occupies part of the main lounge, and is a very convivial space. Sharing of tables at mealtimes is encouraged, so as to facilitate conversation with your fellow guests, while enjoying the delicious, traditional vegetarian meals, which end with samples of some of the many sweets for which Varanasi is famous.

The food is all freshly prepared at the camp site in a round mud hut, built in the local style. The ingredients come from Jodhpur each day. Breakfast consists of cereals, eggs made to order, toast with butter and preserves, coffee/ tea and fresh fruit and juice.

Located close to the bottom of the majestic Meherangarh Fort, Pal Haveli is possibly the best place from which to admire the scope of this architectural feat.

The haveli is made of carved deep red stone. Thick slabs of the stone are interspersed with carved lintels, arches and latticework. A grand entrance opens into a wide courtyard. On one side is the reception. On the other is a stairway which leads up three levels to the rooftop restaurant with its fabulous views. Yet another staircase leads to the family's private quarters and the museum. 

The rooms are delightfully furnished in the typical Rajasthani aristocratic style. Many have accents of the red carved stone - arches or windows and lofty pillars. Most rooms have a cosy seating area. The furniture and fabrics are all locally sourced and add a touch of earthy colours. All rooms have modern en-suite bathrooms. 

The rooftop restaurant is the piece de resistance. This terrace, located at one of the highest points in Jodhpur offers panoramic views of all the main monuments of the city. At night, the restaurant takes on a mysterious air, with soft lighting, candles on the table and the spectacular sight of the illuminated Meherangarh Fort. 

A part of the Haveli has been converted into a small but interesting museum. Here you can see the armour, swords and shields, which were so much a part of the life in Rajasthan. There are also ceremonial robes and dresses, ornaments and many other interesting artefacts. The rooms in the museum are decorated in traditional style, with low seating and glass lamps.

For the more sedate guests, there is a swimming pool with the most dramatic views in Goa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Far away from the beach, where Goa borders its neighbours, Maharashtra and Karnataka, lies the Wildernest resort. Wildernest is set on over 450 acres of forest land overlooking the stunning Swapnagandha Valley.

Many may have heard of the mineral mines that have destroyed so much of Goa's hills and forests. Well, Wildernest is a case where one such denuded hill was re-planted by someone with his priorities (and heart) in the right place. Today, the 300 acres are thickly covered once again with continuous efforts at re-forestation. The hills are once again alive with the sound of birds and other wildlife. 

One of the founders is young Nirmal Kulkarni, Goa's best known conservationist and naturalist. Nirmal has worked long and hard in these hills and is a true champion of Goa's ecology. 

But is the resort attractive to a tourist who may not be so keen to be involved in any ecological struggle while they are on a holiday? The answer is yes! There are naturalist led walks and hikes for the intrepid. For the more sedate guests, there is the swimming pool, possibly the most dramatic in Goa. Seeming to hang over the several hundred feet deep valley below and surrounded by high green hills, the swimming pool is the single biggest attraction of Wildernest.

The cottages, named after fragrant local flowers, are spread in the light woods around the main restaurant/lounge area. They are entirely wooden, with high ceilings, comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms. Each cottage has a sit-out or a verandah overlooking either the forest or the valley below. Both views are magnificent. 

The resort employs only local people from these hilly areas. The staff members are warm and simple and extremely eager to share the many delights of the resort and its surrounding area. 

So, if you would like to explore Goa beyond the usual sun drenched beaches, travel up to Wildernest.

From the rampart walls you can have breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside. 

Madhogarh is a typical small Rajasthani town, even today communities of potters, carpenters, cobblers, carpet makers etc. can be seen plying their trade in the centuries old traditional way. 

You'll have the opportunity to explore the nearby village to get an insight into rural India.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A short drive from Jaipur brings you to this quiet, rural part of Rajasthan. Fort Madhogarh  sits on top of a hill with excellent views of the entire countryside. The chief job of the forts, of course, was to offer shelter from marauding armies. Therefore the forts were all prepared for battle - and the location was of paramount importance. 

The same turrets, terraces and ramparts which created the defensive barriers, today can be enjoyed for the sunrise and sunset views. Breakfast in Madhogarh is often served on the turrets - making it a surreal experience. 

The fort is recently turned into a heritage hostelry and is run by a very charming young couple, Shiv and Cutie, who personally supervise every aspect of running their home. 

A series of small courtyards bring you the central area. A semi enclosed lounge with  comfortable deep sofas and chairs opens out here. On the opposite side is a small platform where traditionally musicians sat to entertain the family and guests as they had their meals. This tradition still continues and you will be serenaded by a very local singer, and old man, accompanied by his shy daughter-in-law and young grandson. 

The rooms on the upper level are accessed by a few different staircases. Each room is different, with its own character. All rooms have en-suite facilities. The rooms are done in a style that matches the fort - traditional wooden furniture and hand-block printed fabrics. Some rooms sport the original frescoes and arches.

15 rooms are spread over 3 floors to try and make sure that all rooms have a view or balcony. Glass panes let in copious amounts of sunlight. Simple low wooden beds and armchairs occupy the majority of the room. The attached bathroom is clean and has hot water throughout the day. Aside from the television with international channels and a fan to get the air circulating (its only very rarely that Dharamsala gets really warm) there is also a small kitchenette. Keeping in mind their long term guests the hotel also rents out pots and pans at a nominal price. 
  
The restaurant is lined again with the same light wood as the rooms and a cheerful chequered floor. The food served here is all vegetarian (in good Buddhist tradition), freshly made and served piping hot. Their Italian and Tibetan dishes are well known and widely appreciated, their pizzas and salads especially appreciated. 
  
Take your meal out on the balcony of the restaurant and watch the multi-coloured Tibetan prayer flags fluttering in the breeze. Stroll down to the street stalls of the market place and share a joke or two with the ever cheerful Tibetan shopkeepers.

There are separate chalets varying in size and location, arranged in and around Mrs. Bhandari's charming red-brick colonial home, complete with original 1950's fittings, furniture and atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tehmi Bhandari was born in 1906 into a wealthy Parsi family. She heard the firing at Jallianwallah Bagh in 1919 and her efforts at sowing clothes for refugees during the Partition were praised even by Lord Mountbatten. Outliving two husbands, Mrs. Bhandari converted the brick and bougainvillea covered home into a guesthouse and ran it for some 50 years in order to support her family. 

Mrs Tehmi Bhandari sadly passed away a few years ago but her daughters now manage the place and have succeeded in preserving the atmosphere of an old army guesthouse - the furniture is functional but charming, the colours art-deco pastels and there are buffaloes to supply fresh milk and cream everyday. 

The rooms come in all shapes and sizes and are housed in outhouses placed around the main building. What they may lack in modern facilities, is more than made up for by their character and nostalgic feel with claw footed bathtubs resting on patterned tiles, pink, yellow and green walls and chairs and dressing tables of the unmistakable clean-lined art-deco variety. The rooms even have functional fireplaces and the wood for it is provided at extra charge. 

There are neat English lawns at the front and back of the property brightened by pink roses, red pansies and multicoloured dahlias. A simple cement pool is filled with water during the summer months and offers respite from the dry Amritsar heat. Delicious, Indian home cooked food is served on the lawn during summer evenings. 

Breakfasts are enlivened by the thick milk and cream that the buffaloes provide. The buffaloes aren't the only animals around; several friendly dogs roam the property and only add to the laid back, unpretentious atmosphere of the place.

As you pass the main north Goa road from Calangute to Anjuna, you will see some colourful flags fluttering among paddy fields. This is Yoga Magic. There are tents spread around the well tended plantation of coconuts and other local trees. Each tent is covered by a thatch roof thus keeping it cool and giving a large shaded sit-out at the front. 

The electricity is provided by small solar panels just outside each tent. The tents are spacious, easily putting to shame many hotel rooms. There are beds and bedside tables with plenty of space to walk around. Beyond the bedroom, there is a dressing/lounge area with a comfortable mattress spread Indian style on the floor. True to the ecologically sound policies of Yoga Magic, the toilets use no chemicals. The pot itself is squat style and once you are finished, you have to sprinkle the matter with wood shavings and then spray it with a special liquid that helps to bio-degrade the waste in record time. This then is used as manure in the gardens, especially for the banana and other fruit trees. The method obviously works, as these are some of the most odour-free toilets we have come across! 

Yoga Magic holds special yoga and meditation residential camps. There is a large, thatched space which serves as the venue for the classes for yoga and meditation. An Ayurveda massage specialist is at hand to take away any aches and pains.

The cottages are all built using local materials, have spacious modern bathrooms, and are of 3 distinct types.

The Bhunga cottages imitate the mud and thatch huts of the pastoral Rabari tribe. Their circular shape and small windows are designed to circulate fresh air and limit the entry of sunlight and heat. White clay, and mirrors fashioned into the customary folk designs, brightens the interiors. 

The sturdier, tiled Kooba homes are representative of the weaving community of the Bajanias who still practice their craft in the nearby village of Dasada. Their white walls are lined with framed pieces of fabric that exhibit the various styles of embroidery and tie and die fabric work found in the Kutch region. The small patio in front of each Kooba cottage features the hand carved wooden brackets of ancestral Gujarati homes and is complete with simple rope and wooden swings. 

The stone cottages sit back from the rest of the resort and are closer to the pond that is often completely covered by water lilies. They are cool and furnished with dark wood furniture that gives them a comforting forest lodge feel.

2412,"Situated in the heart of the old `Ville Blanche' (white town) of French Pondicherry, at 5 Rue de la Caserne, is one of Indias most striking designer hotels.

Constructed in the 18th century as the residence of the Mayor of Pondicherry, the building stands white and majestic on an important corner of the French town. 

It is located just a few blocks from the shimmering waters of the Indian Ocean and Pondicherry's famous leafy park. 

The central shopping district is just around the corner, too, as are a number of restaurants and coffee shops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The journey into the past starts as soon as you reach the wooden gate, one of the oldest in Pondicherry, made famous in numerous paintings and photos of the colonial era. As you open the gate you enter an atmospheric courtyard, the heart of the restored building, and discover a slice of Old France meticulously renovated to create a modern hotel.

The old building was completely refinished with a traditional lime plaster known as ""Chettinad Egg Plaster."" In this process, walls are covered with layer after layer of a thin coating of egg white, powdered sea shells and yogurt. Each layer is polished by hand, and the result is a uniquely smooth and soft texture.

The exquisite woodwork, perhaps the best example of French Indian carved woodwork in Pondicherry, is all original, recovered from the house of Joseph Francois Dupleix, which used to stand on the old Nehru Street. Dupleix was the greatest of the Generals and Governers of French India. During his tenure, the French were the dominant power in South India and the British were contained to Madras.

The original building has been expanded, and the hotel has been modernised with the use of materials such as glass and metal to create a delicate mix of modernity and tradition. This mix offers the warmth of the old, but at the same time ensures that the hotel is comfortable and efficient, equipped with Internet connections, mini bars, room service, and imported bathtubs and fittings. It is in this harmony between the traditional and modern that Le Dupleix exists not just as another heritage hotel, but as a unique and striking designer hotel.

The hotel has 14 elegant suites, each with its own character. No two rooms are alike. Every detail has a purpose. The result is a hotel that surprises at every turn.",,le-dupleix,"Situated in the heart of the old `Ville Blanche' (white town) of French Pondicherry, at 5 Rue de la Caserne, is one of Indias most striking designer hotels.","Le Dupleix in Pondicherry - Travel in India | Travellers Palm",,"Le Dupleix","5 Caserne Street",Pondicherry,"605 001",200,"222 6999, 222 6001-5",2335278,,"info@ledupleix.com

Since the hotel is located slap bang on the beautiful esplanade that lines Pondy's coast, it would be a shame to be stuck in a room with no access to that gorgeous view. So we recommend the Sea Facing Rooms that are slightly more expensive and not very different from their Deluxe Rooms but well worth the extra moolah for the feeling of opening those louvered French windows in the morning to the grey green waters.

2438,"The Lemon Tree is a 4 star business hotel with a difference. Gone are the beiges and greens that business hotels use ad nauseum and stiff upper lip service is replaced with a smilingly efficient staff. 

If the whites and cheerful lemon yellows of their lobby and the blue of their enormous swimming pool isn't enough to convince you, by the time you get to your stylish wood paneled, sun filled room with a pool view, you will be sold on Lemon Tree's light hearted, full service hotel concept.      ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Lemon Tree Aurangabad is all about providing you with comfort efficiently, cost effectively and cheerfully.

The serene white of the lobby continues into the corridors and rooms. But while the corridors are fairly bare, in the rooms this white is used as a canvas against which to splash turquoise, red and green. The light coloured wood used in the furniture is subtly lit by muted lighting. There are bold tribal and modern art paintings on the walls with an unconventional display of swirls and nature motifs. 

However, there is nothing neither rural nor experimental about their orthopaedic mattresses and fine linen. I am proudly informed that these are the same as those provided to the guests of the uber posh Taj hotels.

The extra facilities that this self proclaimed ""moderate price category hotel"" offers are impressive.  A fairly unexciting multi cuisine restaurant opens up on to a more relaxed, cane chaired tea lounge adjoining the pool. Their sports bar cum pub or the 'Slounge' is decorated with action figures and houses a bar with an award winning bar tender and a play station. Their glass walled gym is wrapped by the blue waters of the pool and the spa offers Swedish and Thai massages as well as beauty treatments.",,lemon-tree-hotel-aurangabad,"The Lemon Tree is a 4 star business hotel with a difference.

Tea Bungalow has 10 large en-suite rooms each named after a port involved in spice and tea trading from lands around the Indian Ocean. The rooms are named Cochin, Zanzibar, Galle, Mombasa, Muscat, Malacca, Mauritius, Cambay, Goa and Calicut. Each room has deft design touches of each ethnic port. 

The Tea Bungalow blends the history as a residence for execs of the tea company, with the modernity of a western 'boutique' hip hotel style. Polished hardwood floors, French windows, floor length drapes, high ceiling red tiled roof and an exquisite chandelier are complemented by vibrant colours and beautifully designed modern bathrooms.

A short flight of steps leads to the front verandah with exquisite flooring of red cement with in-situ patterns. An ideal place to enjoy the front garden is around the large round table with easy chairs around it. A newly created swimming pool right opposite the porch somewhat mars the period feel, although it would be great in the summers. 

The Manor is the family home of a tea-baron, acknowledged as Assam's richest tea grower. And despite being open to select guests, it still serves as the residence of the octogenarian owner. The entire manor is a feast for the eyes; from high ceilings, walls full of family photos, to stately furniture with touches of gilt, carpets and above all, the stunning collection of art. The formal dining room has a golden light cast by chandeliers and wall scones. Dinner is served here on excellent china and gleaming silverware.

The rooms are vast and filled with stuffed sofas and armchairs, carpets and impressive beds. We spent happy hours admiring the various paintings drawings and photographs.

The cottages are almost as breathtaking as the views that fill the French doors and large windows. Gleaming hardwood floors with colourful rugs, a fireplace, a few comfortable armchairs with footstools and an extra large bed with handmade bedspread! There is also a loft here where a child can sleep. 

A dressing room with deep wardrobes open into the bathroom with its generous sized Jacuzzi and a separate shower area. The balcony in the front has a dazzling view and some more comfortable chairs. Below us were landscaped slopes going down towards the lake. 

The more economical rooms here are just slightly smaller than the cottages, but come minus the loft, dressing room and the Jacuzzi. Our advice would be to splurge a bit and go for one of the cottages. 

The restaurant serves a good variety of food. On a negative note though, the resort is open to non-residents and especially over a weekend seems to draw many noisy families for lunch and dinner. The service was polite if strained due to the number of guests. We would strongly suggest that you order your food through room service and eat there. 

Khem Janai - the spa at Ri Kynjai ferries you to the ancient world of herbal cure and serenity. Equipped with state - of - the - art hydro therapeutic facilities, ""Khem Janai"" offers traditional Khasi massages and herbal treatment. The unique feature of the spa is its ""Khasi bath"". The Khasi bath is a water massage which leaves you feeling rejuvenated and recharged.

The grounds of Ri Kynjai are large and beautiful with pine trees, tree ferns, a small show-case tea-garden and many other shrubs. It is a peaceful area to stroll around in with glimpses of the lake.

2513,"The spectacular Diphlu River Lodge is located on the banks of the Diphlu river, at the edge of the Kaziranga National Park. The 12 large wooden cottages boast all necessary comforts and surround an attractive rice paddy.  There are several comfortable vantage points over the river to the National Park, where wildlife is often seen. This is the most luxurious base from which to explore Kaziranga, and to enjoy relaxation in comfortable surroundings between safaris. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For the very up-scale clientele, the arrival of Diphlu Lodge is a wonderful addition. Arriving at a non-descript gateway, you would have no idea what waits you. 

The rustic-luxurious bamboo-and-thatch cottages of the lodge blend perfectly with the forests. The cottages, made stand on tall stilts around an open area where the resort maintains an actual paddy field. The ambience therefore is totally Thai or Balinese. A charming if slightly shaky low bamboo bridge is the walkway in the resort. Walking over the paddy field in this manner is a lovely experience. 

The Diphlu river runs just meters away from the resort and most cottages offer a good view of the river. The cottages are buff coloured, merging well into the greenery and earthy environment. Inside, the vernacular architecture provides just about every modern amenity one can want; deep mattresses and quality linen, a fridge (with a cane cabinet cover), cozy sofas and best of all, sit-outs on either side. 

The bathroom is a visual delight with glass walls and a thatch cover, a very Balinese affair. A note of caution here is to be careful about slipping. The tiles are a bit on the slippery side and the glass is not of the toughened variety. So, guests are cautioned to be extra careful here. 

The best feature of the resort though, is the common lounge, which is the only tall structure. Built with an abundance of bamboo, hardwood with planters' chairs placed strategically to give the best of river view, the lounge is a sheer delight. Guests can luxuriate on the deep sofas after a morning of bumping around in jeeps on elephant back. There is a well stocked bar, the best we came across in Assam. The food is served in style in the dining room, and there are many exciting wildlife activities on offer, including river trips in a dugout canoe.

Overall, with its unique concept of cottages and well trained staff, the Diphlu River Lodge is a first class game lodge.",,diphlu-river-lodge,"The lovely new Diphlu River Lodge is located on the banks of the Diphlu river, at the edge of the Kaziranga National Park. ","Diphlu River Lodge in Kaziranga - Travel in India | Travellers Palm","diphlu river, kaziranga,  assam, rhinos, elephant, safaris, tours","Diphlu River Lodge","Kuthari

This property was designed in the 1970's by renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa as the Coat's Madurai Club.

Grey granite is used liberally in the roughly-hewn pillars that line the corridors and in the most unusually shaped pool - a rectangle with a cascade of steps on each side - has been designed to represent the water tanks found in major South Indian temples.

The rooms are, perhaps, the simplest aspect of the hotel, and are maybe deliberately kept so in order to enhance their restorative nature. But all of them have an outdoor seating area from which you can enjoy the many subtle aspects of the hotel.

You can relax on the verandah of your houseboat overlooking the serene Nageen Lake and the mountains beyond.",,,,,,,,,,12:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Staying on a houseboat in Srinagar is a unique, must-do experience. The houseboats generally have three or four bedrooms, each with attached bathroom, electricity and modern plumbing. There is a common dining and lounge area, as well as a balcony at the front facing the lake. Quite a few houseboats have rooftops that are accessible. Some have gardens. These additional areas are appealing as they provide more space for guests. There is also a small kitchen, where the ""boat captain"" assigned to each houseboat is usually found, especially at meal times, when large numbers of local dishes will be served to you. 

The famous Dal Lake is where the majority of the houseboats are located. However, it's also crowded and commercial and in some areas the houseboats are unattractively lined up bumper to bumper along a canal. On the other hand, Nigin Lake is much smaller, quieter, and more picturesque. So we use houseboats which are located on Nagin Lake.

Unlike houseboats in Kerala, these houseboats don't move. They're permanently docked on the lake. Houseboats docked lengthways along the lake will usually offer lake views from their bedrooms. Otherwise bedrooms will have a view of the neighboring houseboat but their balconies will be fronting the lake.

The famous Kashmir Houseboats originated during the period of the British Raj. Kashmir's ruler would not allow the British (who were as fond of Kasmir's cool climate as the Mughals) to own land in his kingdom. So they adopted the solution of building houseboats as a compromise - each one a little bit of England, afloat on Srinagar's lakes.

The houseboats soon evolved from modest floating homes to veritable floating palaces. They now range from 60 to 150 ft. long, are 15 to 20 ft. wide and each is unique. The cedar interiors are intricately carved and display the consummate artistry of Kashmiri craftsmen. The furnishings include embroidered native rugs and fabrics, local objects d'art, and solidly comfortable Victorian and Edwardian furniture. This is a reminder of times gone by, and there is no better way to experience the reflective atmosphere and tranquility inspired by the nearby Himalayas than from the traditional and spacious home comforts of your very own houseboat.

The best way to experience the life of Nageen Lake is from one of the hand rowed boats, known as Shikaras, which are constantly seen transporting both people, local produce, and all sorts of goods, around the lake. The boatman will take you beyond the lake and into the small canals which thread their way through the vegetable and flower gardens where you will witness the unusual practice of farming on the water, as well as fishermen and plenty of birdlife. It is an extraordinarily tranquil, and colourful, scene, mostly unchanged for centuries, and is a highlight of any visit to Srinagar.

Folklore has it that the sons of the Kadathanadu rulers were sent to Calicut to be educated in institutions set up by the Zamorin of Calicut, and hence a city house was built for the young princes.

Doctor couple, Srikumar and Neeta Srikumar are the inheritors of the royal residence that was purchased by Neeta's grandfather in 1960. It was only in 2000 that the neurologist decided to rescue the dilapidated property from ruin and convert it into a heritage resort. The original structure was kept intact, the massive doors and windows made of Irul and Jackfruit wood were retained and some panels from the windows were replaced with glass for more light and ventilation.

The anterooms of the main bedrooms were converted into bathrooms with all modern amenities. The low roof of the kitchen was dismantled and the first floor was eliminated to create a high ceiling for the new kitchen. The lawns were painstakingly manicured and landscaped. 

Also dotting the backyard is a selection of ayurvedic plants and herbs. Because, while Harivihar functions as a heritage resort,  its mainstay is Ayurveda. Guests can avail of treatments under the supervision of Dr Mali and Dr Ramakrishnan, famed Ayurvedic practitioners of the region. Harivihar has also been awarded the Green Leaf accredition by the Kerala tourism department-the only facility in Kerala in its class to have been awarded this honour. 

The day begins very simply at Harivihar. Wake up to the sound of chirping birds at your window, go in for a session of Yoga. Then choose between a Pancha Karmam or Shodhanam-a five step purification treatment for the body. Special treatment for longer durations include Shiro Dhara, Pizhichil, Navarakkizhi, Shirovasti and Kizhi.

It also doubled up as a lighthouse from where Bristow used to watch the ships that sailed into and out of the port. The original lighthouse mast still stands on the property.

Till the late 1980's the bungalow served as a residence for the senior officers of the port. Gradually, perhaps owing to steep maintenance costs and other issues, this lovely building was left to run to seed. Now acquired on a long lease, the present owners put in tremendous renovation work to turn this heritage structure back to its old grandeur. 

There are six garden view rooms that are well-designed and comfortable, three deluxe suites which are very spacious and provide a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea from the en suite balcony, as well as two luxurious villas. The best are the two rooms on either end of the upper storey. They have private balconies that face the sea directly.

The Bristow's Bistro is an outdoor dining area, overlooking the sea and the Fort Kochi beach. There's nothing like a quiet evening, watching the sunset on the Arabian Sea, or the fishermen coming back home, listening to the music of the waves and munching fresh, hot, spicy seafood delicacies.

There is a large swimming pool with a jacuzzi and an in-house spa, offering a wide variety of treatments from the traditional Kerala Ayurvedic massages to Balinese and Swedish beauty treatments.

The aim was to tread lightly in this tiger country and the creators have succeeded in this - the Safari Lodge can easily pass off as a local village. The landscaping is designed with water harvesting in mind. Local artists have created the bricks and the adobe walls with traditional wall paintings. The roof supports in the verandahs are tree trunks in their natural shapes, chunky and rustic. Inside is lovingly polished wood, neutral colours brightened by accent pillows and eye catching art on the walls. Many trees have been added to the site and extensive rainwater harvesting is followed. 

Committed to eco-tourism, the Samode Safari Lodge uses natural materials and elements of regional art and architecture, with eco-friendly landscaping and water management systems. It has been designed and built with the lightest possible environmental footprint. The aim was to create luxury in the most sustainable manner. Not only have no trees been cut for building the lodge, but new planting has also been done. 

The adjoining villages of Mardari and Gohori are the inspiration for the architectural language of the Lodge. The walls are constructed with the traditional hand moulded bricks and all the building material has been locally procured. The Lodge uses solar energy and does extensive rain-water harvesting to recharge ground water levels. ",,samode-safari-lodge,,,,"Samode Safari Lodge","Bandhavgarh National Park.

Furnished in bright yet restful colours, the rooms of the hotel are all different from each other: some having warm wood floors while others have large windows that allow you to enjoy views of the mountains right from your bed.

Each of the rooms bears one of the eight auspicious signs of Tibetan Buddhism which is also the reason for the name of the hotel. Take the conch, for example, which symbolizes the deep, cosmic sound of the Dharma teachings of the Buddha. Used here in the paintings that adorn the wall and the embroidery on the bedspread, these are efforts by the hotel and the artists to preserve their threatened Tibetan heritage.

The hotel has a terrace on the roof which is a great place to unwind and for views over the neighbourhood. The hotel's restaurant prides itself on its homemade cookies and cakes and meals. The hotel also offers free wifi facilities throughout the hotel.

The pleasing, meandering structure of the hotel means that most rooms are close to the pool with lawns and swaying palm trees in-between.

The d�cor of the rooms reflects the textile heritage of southern India.",,,,,,5,,,,12:00,,,,,,144,,,,,,,"The Radisson's luxurious chalets, villas and bungalows are spread around manicured gardens stretching 500m to the beach.

Rooms range from large to enormous and the most expensive have private pools. The Radisson also offers Mamallapuram's finest dining and two top-notch spas (one exclusively ayurvedic). 

There are two restaurants to choose from: one, overlooking the sea, which serves Indian and Italian food with equal panache and the other, a pool side all-day restaurant.

The rooms are high-ceilinged, spacious and uncluttered. Fine period inspired furnishings provide just the right finishing touch. There is an inviting plunge pool, located right in the courtyard, and an Ayurvedic massage and treatment centre.

The rooftop restaurant whips up French delicacies, Continental fare and local cuisine with equal ease.",,,,,,3,,,,12:00,,,,,,18,,,,,"American Express, Visa, Mastercard.",,"An elegant, low slung building the colour of mango mousse and colonial white, the Palai de Mahe beckons you with the promise of a lazy swim in the blue waters of its pool and an even lazier nap in a planters chair on its wide verandah.

Colonial elegance define this building in the former French colony of Pondicherry. Potted plants line the corridors and fans whirl slowly overhead. The beautiful period furniture is used but sparingly contributing to the general feeling of airiness, a welcome trait in a warm, humid place like the south east coast of India.

The Casino Group of Hotels, to which the Palais de Mahe hotel belongs, prides itself on its food and emphasizes raditional recipes and fusion cuisine. You can choose to dine in the outdoor seating area by the pool or under the cool of the tiled roof on the first level.  

With only a handful of rooms the hotel can quickly start feeling like home or rather a holiday home. Step out of the hotel and you're on the quiet streets of the French Quarter with its wealth of elegant French colonial style buildings in pastel and white.

2738,"Amanbagh, meaning ""peaceful garden"", lies in a verdant oasis, fed by a nearby lake, and previously the site of the Maharajah of Alwar's hunting lodge and pleasure garden. 

Amanbagh is a refined palatial-style mansion, a unique latter day haveli, architecturally faithful to the impressive, imperial Moghul dynasty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The topography of the Alwar region consists of sandy plains interspersed with craggy hills, a stark contrast to Amanbaghs setting which is an oasis of verdant greenery. 

Deriving its name from aman, meaning peace in Sanskrit and bagh, meaning garden in Hindi, Amanbagh lies within a walled compound once used by the Maharajah of Alwar to site his mobile hunting camps in search of the elusive tigers known to roam the nearby hills. Long since abandoned, the trees and vegetation continued to thrive due to a reliable source of underground water. The resort is very much a modern day Mughal Palace, conceived in the present, but paying homage to the architecture and design of Indias golden age.

Made almost entirely of pink sandstone by local stonemasons, there are 16 Pool Pavilions and 24 Havelis. Pool Pavilions are set around the perimeter of the resort, each with their own private pool and garden. The Havelis are set amongst the date and mango trees with their own private courtyard, garden or balcony. All suites feature a large bathtub carved from Udaipur green marble and are fitted with Bose sound systems and a personal bar.

As well as a large 33m/108 ft. marbled magnetic main swimming pool, Aman Spa, informal dining area and wading pool, there is a well-stocked library and a roof terrace elevated above a canopy of trees, which has fabulous views over the surrounding countryside.

If you can bear to leave the premises, you can undertake a number of truly worthwhile activities: picnics into the countryside, hike to ancient Somsagar Lake, explore the haunted ruins at Bhangarh, visit the archaeological sites in the Paranagar area. 

For the less active or those simply looking to relax then the resort is perfect it has a beautiful swimming pool, a spa and also offers yoga and meditation classes.

Dining is world-class.The excellent restaurant serves a delicious selection of local dishes as well as a wide range of other cuisine.

The recently-opened Vivaana Hotel is housed inside one of these painted havelis and lets you get up close to these wonderful paintings.

Built in the 19th century, the hotel has a rambling feel with each room being a different shape and size as in all true heritage hotels. All rooms, however, have their walls lined with graceful hand-painted frescoes which the owners have been careful as not to over-restore in their effort to create an authentic atmosphere.

A large lawn forms the centre of the hotel which is a great space to relax and grab a bite in. There is a large pool to cool off in, especially welcome during the long, hot summer days. If you are a family with young children they are sure to appreciate the open spaces and in-house pool.

The village surrounding the haveli is, of course, fascinating, being part of the Shekhawati region that was once a stop on the famed Silk Route. The villagers are known to be friendly and any walk is sure to give you wonderful insight into the village's history as well as the daily life in a present-day Indian village.

If you're looking forward to try the famous 'lal maas' (literally 'red meat') curry that is a signature Rajasthani dish, this is a good place to try it.

The lodge has 14 independent cottages where every possible comfort had been taken care of - from the plump cushions on the bed and window seat, the large satellite TV, the marble floors adorned with rugs, the pencil drawings on the stone walls and the beautiful teak furniture - all giving the impression of a luxurious African safari lodge.",,,,,,,,,,"11:00 Hrs",,,,,,14,,,,,,,"The cottages of the Blackbuck Lodge are as good as they get. Luxuriously furnished, with high quality linen and light fittings. Rooms are spacious, with king beds, a study table and chair and space created by the windows to sit around - or even for a child to sleep. Air-conditioning is very effective for warm days, or you can enjoy fresh air on the deck chairs in the veradah - ideal for sunbathing and watching Blackbucks. 

The bathrooms are big too, with a tub and shower. There is a separate shower open-to-the-sky too; it's fun, and no one can see you! Surprisingly, each cottage has a flat screen television set connected to a dish for clear reception. There are facilities to make your tea / coffee in the room.

The park gates are about half a mile away, but you don't even need to go there all the time when Nature's creations come to you in your lodge anyway. The back door of the cottage leads straight on to your very own terrace with cushioned teak chairs from which you can survey the surroundings and wait for blackbuck, nilgai and birdlife to turn up for a drink. 

You can go for safaris in your own car, or book one in the lodge's old Wiley jeeps. Other amenities include a library with comfortable sofas and a dining where you can request cuisines of your choice.

Meals are made using fresh ingredients, taste good and served in fine crockery. There are no other eating options around, but you will not have reasons to complain here.

An old Bungalow converted into a hotel, Razhu Pru is located in the Historical Kohima Village. Being located in the Mission compound, the starting point of the Kohima village and near the church, it simply makes for a wonderful stay with great views of the village and the valley! 

The Rhaza Pru has about 8-10 guest rooms, all comfortable but fairly spartan. Electricity is often off in Kohima, so it pays to heat up water (individual controls in the spotless bathrooms) well ahead of need. The food is healthy and breakfasts wholeseome. But it is the charm of this historic ""cottage"", the taste with which its decoration has been carried out, the appeal of its hill-side location and the availability of terrace and garden, that make it such a happy surprise in Kohima. The staff are endlessly willing and kind, and the owners attentive to guest needs. The hotel aims to be a second home for visitors and succeeds.

The quaint mud and jute restaurant serves great meals. At night you can enjoy a bonfire and barbeque dinner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A rustic jungle lodge in a recently opened national park gives you to perfect opportunity to feel like a pioneer explorer into the jungles of Pench National Park. The log huts and other structures of the camp have been constructed using local materials and traditional wisdom, such as using dry reed for roofing that helps regulate the extremes of temperature the park experiences and mud to build the dining area.

Rather than creating an environment so polished as to make you forget your proximity to the wild, at Tribal Camp you are encouraged to remember the wildlife that you are here to experience. Yet, modern conveniences like air coolers in the summer, hot and cold running water and attached bathrooms have been provided. The food has often been appreciated by guests for its 'made at home' flavour.

Perhaps, the most important aspect of any jungle lodge is the quality of the jungle guides. At Tribal Camp the owners are so actively involved as to accompany some jeep safaris and consciously use guides with in-depth local knowledge, often employed from the local tribal communities.

You'll probably want to make a couple of jeep safaris into Pench National Park simply in order to do justice to the wealth of wildlife and landscapes it offers: leopards and tigers, mouse deer and spotted deer, monitor lizards and marsh crocodiles, numerous water birds drawn to the waters of the Pench River and the many artificial water bodies and, of course, the unique landscape of teak forests.",,tribal-camp-pench,,,,"Tribal Camp","Jamuntola

Yet the building retains its elegance which is replicated in its furnishings. Ornate carved furniture is juxtaposed with light colours and flooring so as to keep the feel airy yet authentic.

But, like anywhere, the thing that turns a building from a house into a home are the people and the staff and owners of Baruah Bhawan are known for their unflagging generous hospitality.  

The present owner, Mr Raj Baruah, is often on the premises and has an long and respected career in the Merchant Navy. He was also, at one time, in charge of the Government of Assam's fleet of river vessels. Son of Dr Birnichi Baruah who founded the Guwahati University and the Assam Academy for Cultural Relations, any conversation with him is likely to enrich your understanding and knowledge of the state of Assam.

The cottages and rooms (except for one concrete cottage) have all been built of bamboo and stand on stilts, replicating the traditional houses of the local Mishing community. The in-house restaurant serves some delicious Assamese and Mishing cuisine and even a glass of the local rice brew, apong, on request. 
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Constructed by a French couple, Jim Chauvin and Maka Korbaa in 2005, it is now looked after by the head caretaker Monjit Risong, who lives next door with his family, and a small, affable staff. The other half of the eco-friendly property across the lane, built a few years later and renovated last year, is the contribution of an Englishman, Ian McCarthy.

While here, visit the Neo-Vaishnavite monasteries to learn about Assamese culture, opt for birdwatching or a boat ride in Luit Ghat or rent a cycle to make your way towards small streams that lie across paddy fields and make for perfect sunset spots. Monjit gladly guides guests to local festivals and around Mishing villages on request, showing you sides of the island that not many travellers have seen.
