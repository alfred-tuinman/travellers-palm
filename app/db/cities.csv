Road: Ajanta is connected by motorable roads with Aurangabad, Jalgaon,  Fardapur.","Vivid Paintings : The paintings or frescoes in the caves enthral the spectator with their rich
 beauty, expressiveness, radiant colour schemes, balanced compositions and fine shading which highlight the delicate artistry and idealised physical features. The colour scale is extremely simple, there being only red, blue, yellow ochre and lamp-black. The themes of the paintings are generally religious and centre on the Buddha and various Buddhist divinities. Depicting the whole cycle of human life from birth to death, these paintings hold a mirror to
the contemporary life of the monastery, the village, the town, the court and the palace. 
The caves most well known for their wall paintings are Caves 1, 2, 16, 17, and 19. Two of the
best-known murals Bodhisattva Padmapani with a lotus and Bodhisattva Vajrapani holding a
thunderbolt are found in Cave 1. Cave 2 is remarkable for its painted ceiling with large medallions, delicate bands of lotus flowers, scrollwork and abstract patterns. Cave 16 is one of the finest monasteries with the most beautiful painting of the 'Dying Princess'. The greatest number of wall paintings are preserved in Cave 17, which also depicts the unusual 'Wheel of Life' composition displaying all of creation. 

Halls of Worship: Two basic types of Buddhist monastic architecture are observed here. In the chaitya hall (shrine) of the Hinayana phase, the focus of the interior is the monolithic stupa, or a plain hemisphere raised on a platform. The viharas (monasteries) of this period have a simple hall with residential cells cut into the walls on three sides. The chaitya halls of the Mahayana phase are different. Their interior columns have decorated capitals and brackets. The viharas of this period comprise a square hall with a Buddha shrine.

Vibrant Sculptures: Most of the ornate sculptures are from the Mahayana period. These carvings are remarkable for their classic qualities and display a graceful elegance and serenity. In the shrines are huge figures of the Buddha in the meditation and teaching pose. Their benign expression and grace of form evoke a sense of awe and reverence. The most striking sculptures are found in Caves 1, 4, 17, 19 and particularly 26. Cave 26 contains a colossal carved figure of the reclining Buddha, depicting his ultimate salvation from the cycle of
rebirth -- the Mahaparinirvana.

Ajanta View Point: This is the place from where John Smith first glimpsed the Ajanta Caves.

One of India's most beautiful landscapes, the backwaters of Kerala is a vast interconnected network of canals, rivers, lagoons and lakes. An important transportation network for the fishing, spice and rice industries, the backwaters are also home to large communities of villages whose lives revolve around the waters, and exploring them is a highlight of a visit to this most attractive of Indian states. The best way to explore these interweaving waterways is by a traditional houseboat. An over-night stay, with comfortable accommodation on the boat, and a truly Kerala-style dinner is the best way to experience a slice of Gods own country!

<h2>Snake Boat Races</h2>
For a few months every year during the monsoon season, the state of Kerala comes alive with colorful snake boat races. Four main snake boat races (and as many as 15 minor ones) are held each year, in and around Alleppey, the exact dates varying each year depending on the phase of the moon. The exception is the Nehru Trophy Boat Race, which is always held on the second Saturday of August.

A visit to this serene complex is a profound and unique experience.",1,amritsar_1.jpg,amritsar_2.jpg,18,26,,,,,,,1336,,,1,1,,,1,"<h2>Sightseeing in Amritsar</h2>
The Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, is the most important gudwara, or temple, in Sikhism. It was built in the early 1600s from marble and then overlaid with gold leaf. Inside the temple, visitors can find the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy text of Sikhism. Around the temple is a body of water called the Amrit Sarovar, or Pool of Nectar. Amritsar takes its name from this sacred pool. Within the temple, one impressive site is a dining hall where volunteers serve food to 3,500 people in need.

The Golden Temple has been the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion for more than 400 years and is always a hive of activity, especially during the early morning ceremonies. The Sikhs take great pride and pleasure in maintaining the temple premises and showing visitors around the complex. The temple complex is open for almost 20 hours, from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. It's well worth two visits -- during the day and night. Heads must be covered and shoes removed when you enter the temple.

The busy town of Amritsar is also famed for the most notorious massacre during British rule. This took place at Jalianwala Bagh in 1919 and was a major event in India's struggle for independence. The site is now a museum and memorial to commemorate the 2000 Indian protesters who were killed or wounded here.

<h2>When to visit Amritsar</h2>
Amritsar has quite an extreme climate, with very hot summers and very cold winters. The best months to visit are October and November, and February and March. If you don't mind feeling a little chilly, December and January are also good times to visit.

Near it are two Shiva temples, deifying Shiva as Bhuthanatha, God of Souls. Inside the dark inner shrine of the temple, on the edge of the water, he sits in a rarely seen pose, leaning back, angry and impressive.

2. The Jama Mazjid: It is the finest mosque in the Deccan and is crowned by a large onion dome. The invading Aurangzeb, added a grand entrance and painted the floor with 2,250 squares, one for each worshipper. The sacred alcove has the Quran daintily painted on it in letters of gold. 

3. The Ibrahim Roza: A palatial  mosque and tomb is very beautiful and symmetrical with its many delicate minarets. It is said to have inspired the Taj Mahal and was chosen by
Aurangzeb as his residence. Its architect Malik Sandal claimed, ""At the beauty of this
structure paradise stood amazed"". Panels decorated with crosses, lotuses and wheels
signify the religious tolerance of the Adil Shahi dynasty. Built in the 17th century as a tomb for the wife of the 6th Adil Shahi Sultan-Ibrahim Adil Shahll, it also houses his tomb, since he died before she did. 

4. Malik-i-Maidan:  Perched on top of the fort wall, the Malik-i-Maidan a 55 tonne, 4.3 m long cannon was hauled from battle-scarred Purandar in Maharashtra with the help of 400 bullocks, 10 elephants and men. The cannon is really the jaws and throat of a lion devouring elephants. To avoid the deafening explosion, the gunner would submerge himself in a tank of water on the platform. The gunmetal is cool even in the heat. It is said that if you touch it and make a wish, it is granted.  You'll  pass by the Mehtar Mahal with filigreed balconies and slender minarets built for the sweepers of the royal house!","Around Bijapur (Distances and directions from Bijapur): 110 kms, 134 kms and 120 kms
away are the rock cut temples of Aihole, Pattadakal and Badami . Standing close to each other (within a 13 km radius), these temple towns represent Chalukyan architecture at its best.

1. Aihole : Famous as the  'cradle of Indian temple architecture',  Aihole has 125 temples  intricately  carved, rich in detail. The oldest temple is perhaps the 5th century Lad Khan Temple. The Durga (Fort) Temple has a semi-circular apse and a complete portico.

Chalukyan architecture. The biggest temple dedicated to Virupaksheshvara, has a huge
gateway and several inscriptions. In fron of the temple is a majestic 2.6 m high Nandi. The Mallikarjuna and Papanatha Temples, and the Jain Temple from the Rashrakuta period are well worth a visit.

3. Badami : 120 Km from Bijapur is picturesquely situated at the mouth of a ravine between  gold-rust sandstone cliffs . It is a lovely land  with the Hindu and Jain temples carved out of the sandstone hills, beneath which the ancient Bhuthanatha Lake (so called after temples on its shore) spreads out green and-tranquil. It is said to have healing properties. The natural gorge embellished with temples and gateways, leading to this hill city, is one of the most to-be-seen attractions of Badami, besides the famous cave temples with sculpture that seems to come alive under your eyes, graceful and full of vigour. There is a wealth of indispensable inscriptions here about Indian history. The gun point, to reach which you must climb almost chest-high steps, offers a panorama of haunting Badami

From the cave, Prince Siddhartha crossed the Niranjana River to Sujata Village, 5km north of Bodhgaya. Here there is a temple which commemorates the place where he accepted a bowl of rice from a girl named Sujata, after which the temple and village and now named.

Prince Siddhartha then continued to Bodhgaya, where he achieved enlightenment whilst meditating under a Bodhi tree. At the time, this was a forested area. Emperor Ashoka first built a temple here in the 1st century BC. The current Mahabodhi temple dates from the 19th century, and sits at the centre of a large compound.

Apart from visiting a tea estate, Dibrigarh does not have much to offer a tourist keen on sightseeing. However, Dibrugarh is a good base from which to visit Nam Phake Village and Digboi oil town.

<h2>Nam Phake Village</h2>
A living heritage, Nam Phake village is home to the last 2,000 Nam Phake people. Originally from China, they migrated to Thailand and Burma a few centuries ago, but finally settled down in the Dibrugarh district. 

Situated on the banks of Dihing river, the village is clean and picturesque. The Nam Phake people have retained their cultural identity even while welcoming outsiders and travellers. The quaint stilt bamboo houses are clean and still use many age old traditions. The main occupation is agriculture; betel nut, took palms and paddy. 

The pride of the Nam Phake village is the Buddhist temple and monastery which regularly sees overseas visitors. Several politicians and diplomats from Thailand, including the Princess have visited it. The monastery has an incredible number of old manuscripts, with some dating back a few centuries or so!

<h2>Digboi</h2>
Digboi is a famous oil-town, and is Asia's oldest and continuously producing oilfield. Located at the extreme north-eastern corner of India, at the spot of Asia's very first oil well, is now a quaint oil museum. This has life-size statues frozen in the many processes of oil production, with  men bent over machines, and even a scene of an early car being filled at a petrol pump, as the European owners look on! 

Owing to the strong presence of British oil personnel in the history of Digboi, many distinctly styled English bungalows still remain. A drive through this settlement is enough to get lost in a pleasant time-warp, and catch a glimpse of life must have been like.

You can also visit the Digboi War Cemetery, that has 200 graves of different Allied Forces personnel from UK, India, West Africa, Burma, Belgium, USA and Italy who sacrificed their lives during the 1939-1945 War.

Fatehpur Sikri served as Akbar's capital for only a short period of twelve years before the capital was abandoned, apparently due to a lack of water supply. Today Fatehpur Sikri is a ghost city, its architecture is in a perfect state of preservation, and wandering through the palaces it is easy to imagine that this was once a royal residence and a dynamic cultural centre. The white marble Tomb of Sheikh Salim Chisti, Akbar's spiritual adviser, is now observed as a Muslim pilgrimage spot. 

To visit Fatehpur Sikri, from the parking area, you take a non-polluting gas powered minibus to the site entrance. There are 2 separate sections - the ""living"" section, for which an entrances fee is charged, which contains the many palaces which were built for Akbar's various wives and concubines, and the separate ""religious"" section, where there is no entrance charge, where you can enter the tomb of the holy man whose prophesy led to be the construction of Fatehpur Sikri, visit the mosque, and see the largest gate in Asia.

The Navagraha temple is an ancient seat of astrology and astronomy. The Umananda Temple is located on an island in the river reached by county boat and is known for its resident monkeys. ",1,guwahati.jpg,guwahati_2.jpg,135,4,,,,,,,271,,,1,1,,,1,"<h2>Guwahati</h2>
As in most places in Assam, in Guwahati too, the Brahmaputra reigns supreme. One of the main attractions here is a boat ride on the Brahmaputra. The town houses some beautiful areas that date back to the British times. The chaotic markets are beguiling and full of character. Just a short ride along the main city road, is the Umananda temple located on a scenic island. The temple is on the highest point of the island and is a perfect vantage point with fabulous views of the city and the river. It is not uncommon to spot the Golden Langur (monkey) here. 

<h2>Kamakhya Temple</h2> 
The main place for Tantric practices, the hilltop Kamakhya temple is dedicated to Kali or Sati (Shiva's wife). Legend has it that on having her beloved Shiva insulted, she committed suicide. The incensed God then carried her body all over the world. To separate him from the dead body, Vishnu sent his celestial chakra that broke up the body into 51 pieces that scattered all over the earth. These places where parts of the body fell, are venerated as ""Shakti Sthal"" -- a place to worship Shakti/Kali who rules the tantric world. Sati's vulva is supposed to have fallen at Kamakhya and thus this is the centre for all tantric practices. 

The temple complex has an intensely vibrant atmosphere. Priests clad in red robes, with blazing eyes, mesmerized looking devotees and the regular animal sacrifices make this place fit for those who are not faint hearted!  However, those who are willing to brave this, will be rewarded by some incredible surreal happenings and sights. On our visit, we witnessed the sacrifice of a large male buffalo, along with crashing of cymbals and booming drums. Truly tantric experience that is unforgettable!

<h2>Navagraha Temple</h2>
In contrast to the frenzy of the Kamakhya temple, the Navagraha temple is calm and dark. Dedicated to the nine planets (said to be the only temple of this kind anywhere), the interiors are lit only by votive oil lamps. All the planets are represented by lingams arranged in a constellation around the God of Planets, the Sun. Despite the semi-darkness, the temple has positive and calm vibes. We suggest you do visit here and if you know which one it is, look for your ruling planet and offer it some flowers.

<h2>Goa Temples</h2>
Though Goa may come across as a largely Christian state, its origins are rooted in Hindu culture and temples. Many of the present temples in Goa were moved from their original locations during the Portuguese rule which was hostile to Hindu temples. 

The temples in Goa are unlike other temples in India when it comes to the design and architecture. Most temples have a mix of Hindu and Portuguese styles. The almost baroque temples have impressive towers (Deep Stambha) which are lit up by hundreds of lamps on holy days.

In the 16th century, Hampi rivalled Rome in splendour and controlled almost all of south India. After Muslim invasions though, only the stone buildings and a ghost city remained. 

The main tourist spots in Hampi can be divided into two broad areas: the Hampi Bazaar area and the Royal center near Kamalapuram. The 15th-century Virupaksha Temple is located in the Hampi Bazaar area. It is one of the oldest monuments of the town. The tower of the temple rises about 50 m from the ground and the main shrine is dedicated to Virupaksha, a form of Lord Shiva. 

Hemakuta Hill, south of the Virupaksha temple, contains early ruins, Jain temples and a monolithic sculpture of Lord Narasimha, a form of Lord Vishnu. Hemakuta Hill offers excellent views of Hampi Bazaar.

One can still see the `King's Balance' where kings were weighed against grain, gold or money which was then distributed to the poor, the Queen's Bath with its arched corridors, projecting balconies and lotus-shaped fountains that once sprouted perfumed water, the two-storied Lotus Mahal with recessed archways, the huge Elephant Stables, the splendid Vithala Temple, still used for worship, and much more.

Two kilometers east of Hampi Bazaar is the World Heritage Vithala temple, built in the 16th century. The carvings on this temple give an insight into the architectural splendor achieved by the artisans of the Vijaynagar Empire. The outer pillars of this temple are known as ""the musical pillars"" as they produce sounds of different musical instruments.

Apart from the Hampi Bazaar and the Royal center, Anegondi is another area worth visiting. It is a fortified area north of Hampi Bazaar across the Tungabhadra River. There are a number of temples, including the hilltop ""monkey temple"" which offers superb views over the whole area.

",1,hospet.jpg,"",156,15,,,,,,,142,1526,,0,1,,,3,"<h2>Hampi</h2>
The main tourist spots in Hampi can be divided into two broad areas: the Hampi Bazaar area and the Royal center near Kamalapuram. The 15th-century Virupaksha Temple is located in the Hampi Bazaar area. It is one of the oldest monuments of the town. The tower of the temple rises about 50 m from the ground and the main shrine is dedicated to Virupaksha, a form of Lord Shiva. 

Hemakuta Hill, south of the Virupaksha temple, contains early ruins, Jain temples and a monolithic sculpture of Lord Narasimha, a form of Lord Vishnu. Hemakuta Hill offers excellent views of Hampi Bazaar.

Two kilometers east of Hampi Bazaar is the World Heritage Vithala temple, built in the 16th century. The carvings on this temple give an insight into the architectural splendor achieved by the artisans of the Vijaynagar Empire. The outer pillars of this temple are known as ""the musical pillars"" as they produce sounds of different musical instruments.

Between Hampi Bazaar and Vishala temple, one can see the deserted Sule Bazaar,the Achutraya temple. The monolithic statues of Lord Ganesh and Nandi, the Kodandarama temple and the Krishna temple..

The royal center is located between the Hampi Bazaar area and Kamalapuram. There are a number of tourist attractions within the walled area of the royal center. The Lotus Mahal or palace is an intricately designed pavilion within a walled compound, known as the Zenana Enclosure. This palace is a blend of Indo-Islamic architecture and gets its name from the lotus bud carved on its domed and vaulted ceiling. The Elephant quarter is adjacent to the Zenana Enclosure. It is a domed building, which housed the royal elephants. The Queen's Bath, with its unique Islamic architecture, and the Underground Virupaksha temple are other important places to visit within the royal center. 

Apart from the Hampi Bazaar and the Royal center, Anegondi is another area worth visiting. It is a fortified area north of Hampi Bazaar across the Tungabhadra River. There are a number of temples, including the hilltop ""monkey temple"" which offers superb views over the whole area. 

Most parts of Hampi can be reached by road, but a true explorer with ample energy to travel on foot or by bicycle, will see sights of Hampi that are truly memorable.

honour of Guru Padma Sarnbhav's birth anniversary. It also has the largest thanka in Ladakh which is unfurled once in 12 years (next in 1992). Hemis was built in 1630 during the reign  of Sengge Namgyal, an illustrious ruler of Ladakh. It flourished under the Namgyal dynasty for the royalty favoured the Drugkpa Sect which managed the monastery. It is divided into two, the Assembly Hall on the right and the main temple on the left. The Hall, Dukhang, is also used as a 'green room' by the dancers during the festival. The temple is known as Tshogkhang.

","",0,"Leh is Ladakh's principal town. It used to be one of the busiest market towns on the caravan trade between India and Central Asia. These days it retains a distinctly central Asian feel. 

Leh is dominated by the nine-storey Palace, a building in the grand tradition of Tibetan architecture, said to have inspired the famous Potala in Lhasa, which was built half a century later. 

",1,leh.jpg,leh_2.jpg,169,14,,,,,,,1577,,,1,0,,,3,"<h2>The Bazaar and Old Town</h2> 
After spending a day acclimatizing and settling into your hotel, you are most likely to explore Leh soaking up the atmosphere of the bazaar. Sixty odd years ago, this bustling tree lined boulevard was the busiest market between Yarkhand and Kashmir. Merchants from Srinagar and the Punjab would gather to barter for Pashmina wool brought down by nomadic herdsmen from western Tibet, or for raw silk hauled across the Karakorams on Bactrian camels. 

These days, although the street is dotted with kitsch curio shops and handicraft emporiums, it retains a distinctly central Asian feel. Clean shaven Ladakhi Lamas in sneakers and shades rub shoulders with half bearded Baltis from the Karakoram and elderly Tibetan refugees whirring prayer wheels, while now and again, snatches of Chinese music can be heard from the shopkeeper's transistor radios. 

At the bottom of the bazaar, women from nearby villages, stovepipe hats perched jauntily on their heads, sit behind piles of vegetables, spinning wool and chatting as they appraise the passers by. 

<h2>Leh Palace</h2> 
The old palace of the kings of Ladakh overlooks the town from the southwest slope of the Tsemo hill. It has eight storeys and was built by King Sengge Namgyal in the 16th century, at much the same time as the famed Potala of Lhasa - which it resembles. The damage to the palace - one side is gaping open - stems from the Kashmiri invasions of the last century. Like the Shey palace, the Leh palace still belongs to the Ladakhi royal family, who now live in their palace in Stok. 

<h2>Leh Gompa</h2>
The Leh Gompa stands high above the palace and also overlooks the ruins of the older palace of the King of Tagpebums. The Red Gompa, also known as Namgyal Tsemo Gompa, was built in 1430 by King Gvags-Pa-Bum-Ide. It has a fine three-storey high seated Buddha figure flanked by Avalokitesvara on the right and Manjushri on the left. In all there are three Gompas at the top of the hill. The topmost one is in a very ruined condition but offers extremely fine views over Leh and the surrounding countryside. To the right of the palace one can see a Buddha painted on the rocks, a remnant of an earlier monastery. 

<h2>White-water Rafting</h2>
It is possible to do a 3-hour white-water rafting trip on the Indus. The rafting is easy but very scenic when you float down the river. The costs include all transport, gear, food and a guide. The season only lasts from around early July to mid-September.

The central Main Road market is a fascinating mixture of the old and the new, with modern shopping malls alongside colourful traditional markets, where you can gain a unique insight into many aspects of the developing Indian city. There is a large fruit and vegetable market, sweet shops and street food stalls, parades of modern multi story shops, top end hotels, traditional businesses (such as shops selling cycle rickshaws or repairing sewing machines), Hindu shrines, Moslem mosques, and even a Sikh gurdwara. All of this and more is found cheek-by-jowl within the space of just a few hundred meters, and there are few places in India where the transition from a traditional to a modern city can be so easily and enjoyably observed.

Throughout Ranchi, you will notice few if any other foreigners. Because of this, the local people are open, friendly, and helpful. There is none of the occasional harassment which can make exploring some cities in India hard work at times, and people are invariably happy to talk, and to have their photograph taken.

<h2>Ajanta</h2>
The Ajanta Caves (2nd century B.C. till 650 A.D.) reflect the peak of ancient Indian art and architecture. The caves were cut in rocky cliffs above a horseshoe shaped valley to provide prayer halls and places of residence for Buddhist monks. Craft workers cut out the rock and sculpted it whilst others made beautiful murals depicting places, royalty, culture and tales of everyday life in ancient India.

As Buddhism gradually declined, the Ajanta caves were abandoned and eventually forgotten. It was only as recently as the 19th century that a party of British officers discovered the Ajanta caves. Their isolation contributed to the fine state of preservation of the remarkable paintings.

Ajanta remains closed on Mondays.

It is worthwhile spending any leisure time wandering through the bazaars. Jaipur is well known for its beautiful carpets, enameled ornaments, precious and semi-precious stones, brass ornaments and many other arts and crafts. ",1,jaipur.jpg,jaipur_2T.jpg,176,27,,,,,,,73,,,1,1,,,2,"<h2>Jaipur</h2>
Jaipur owes its name, its foundation and its careful planning to the great warrior astronomer Maharaja Jai Singh II. In 1728 he developed his new city, 11 km south of Amber and called it Jaipur, after himself. He laid out the city with its surrounding walls and six rectangular blocks according to the principles of town planning set out in an ancient Hindu treatise on architecture. 

<h2>Amber Fort</h2>
Amber Fort is superbly located, protected by the wild Aravalli hills on all sides. Amber is an enormous complex of forts and palaces. You can walk or take a jeep ride up the steep path which leads to a magnificent complex of palaces, halls, pavilions, gardens and temples built over a period of 125 years by successive rulers. 

<h2>City Palace</h2>
Sawai Jai Singh left Amber Fort and started residing in the City Palace in 1733 and his descendants continue to live there. The City Palace is a rambling complex divided into a series of courtyards, gardens and buildings. The museum here has textiles and Royal costumes, miniatures, carpets and manuscripts.

<h2>Hawa Mahal (Palace of Winds)</h2>
Near to the City Palace is the Hawa Mahal. This building, constructed in 1799 is best seen from the street outside. The palace is just a facade, with stone jails (lattice screens) facing the main street. Hawa Mahal was meant for the Royal ladies who could stand hidden behind the screen to watch the many processions taking place below.

<h2>Jantar Mantar (the Observatory)</h2>
Sawai Jai Singh had a keen interest in astrology. To improve the astronomical calendar, the Jantar Mantar, a superb astronomical observation site was built in the early 18th century. It includes a set of some 20 main fixed instruments. They are monumental examples in masonry of known instruments but which in many cases have specific characteristics of their own. Designed for the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye, they embody several architectural and instrumental innovations. This is the most significant, most comprehensive, and the best preserved of India's historic observatories. It is an expression of the astronomical skills and cosmological concepts of the court of a scholarly prince at the end of the Mughal period. 

<h2>Jaipur's Bazaars</h2>
Planned in great detail by Sawai Jai Singh, Jaipur's bazaars are one of the city's main attractions. There are designated areas for jewelry, fabrics and clothes, precious and semi-precious stones.

<h2>The Jaipur Literature Festival</h2>
The DSC Jaipur Literature Festival considered Asia's leading literature event is a celebration of national and international writers and encompasses a range of activities including film, music and theatre. The Festival is held every year from 21st to 25th January.

The festival programme includes readings, talks, literary lunches, debates, performances, children's workshops and interactive activities held in the beautiful heritage property, Diggi Palace in central Jaipur, Rajasthan.

",1,"","",208,31,,,,,,,,,,0,1,,,1,"Nestled on the banks of the river Ganga, Kanpur stands as one of North Indias major industrial centres with its own historical, religious and commercial importance. ""Cawnpore"" was the Anglicized spelling of the name during the British Raj.

In the 19th century, Kanpur was an important British garrison with barracks for 7,000 soldiers. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, (known in India as the First War of Independence), 900 British were besieged in the fortifications for 22 days by rebels under Nana Sahib. They surrendered on the agreement that they would get safe passage to the nearby Satti Chaura Ghat whereupon they would board barges and be allowed to go by river to Allahabad.

Though controversy surrounds what exactly happened at the Satti Chaura Ghat, and who fired the first shot, it is known that soon afterwards, the departing British were shot at, by the rebel sepoys, and were either killed or captured. Some of the British officers later claimed that the rebels had placed the boats as high in the mud as possible, on purpose to cause delay. They also claimed that Nana Sahib's camp had previously arranged for the rebels to fire upon and kill all the English. Although the East India Company later accused Nana Sahib of betrayal and murder of innocent people, no evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana Sahib had pre-planned or ordered the massacre. Some historians believe that the Satti Chaura Ghat massacre was the result of confusion, and not of any plan implemented by Nana Sahib and his associates. Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson, one of the four male survivors of the massacre, believed that the rank-and-file sepoys who spoke to him did not know of the killing to come.

Many were killed and the remaining 200 British women and children were brought back to shore and sent to a building called the Bibighar (the ladies' home). After some time, the commanders of the rebels decided to execute their hostages. The rebel soldiers refused to carry out orders, and butchers from the nearby town were brought in to kill the hostages three days before the British entered the city on July 18. The dismembered bodies were thrown into a deep well nearby. The British under General Neill retook the city and committed a series of retaliations against the rebel Sepoys and those unfortunate civilians caught in the area, including women, children and old men. The Kanpur Massacre, as well as similar events elsewhere, were seen by the British as an occasion for unrestrained vengeance.

The British dismantled the Bibighar and raised and a memorial railing and a cross at the site of the well. In 1862, they built a church called All Souls' Cathedral in memory of those killed; renamed the Kanpur Memorial Church. This Church still stands at what was the northeast corner of Wheelers entrenchment. The marble gothic screen with the famous `mournful seraph was transferred to the churchyard after independence in 1947, and in its place a bust of Tantya Tope installed at Nana Rao Park. The well is now bricked over, but the remains of a circular ridge and 'Boodha Bargad' (Old Banyan Tree) are still there.

Equally fascinating is the story about the diamond nose stud worn by the goddess believed to have (mis) guided many a ship to a sorry end at the treacherous rocks near the shore.

The beautiful 430 sq km sanctuary, features various habitats. Swampland gives way to jungle, which rises up to deciduous forests and finally to evergreen slopes. 

You can take jeep and elephant safaris into the park to spot the famous one-horned rhinos and a wide array of other animals, from wild buffaloes to delicate swamp deer and elusive tigers and a wide variety of birds.
",1,kaziranga.jpg,kaziranga_2.jpg,217,4,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,3,"<h2>Kaziranga National Park</h2>
The National Park - a World Heritage Site - covers about 430 sq kms, bordered on the north by the Brahmaputra River and on the south by the Karbi Anglong hills. The largest number of one-horned rhinoceros in the world roams its swamps, grasslands with tall thickets of elephant grass and areas of mixed deciduous and tropical semi-evergreen forest. It is home to a wide variety of other animals and birds, and the open vistas make it relatively easy to see many species of wildlife in a day.

The other large game includes wild buffalos, extremely impressive animals with curved horns and a short fuse! Even the tiger population gives them a wide berth! There are wild elephants living in herds, but you may come across a solitary male. The reserve also has a good numbers of wild boars. The prey base is enormous - large herds of swamp and hog deer can be seen grazing in the grasslands. The bird-life is rewarding too - the rare greater adjutant stork, Bengal florican, black-necked stork, lesser adjutant stork, Pallas's fish eagle, swamp partridge, grey peacock-pheasant, great pied hornbill, green imperial pigeon, babblers and thousands of migratory birds, seasonally attracted to the various water areas of the park from as far away as Siberia.

As far as game spotting goes, Kaziranga never disappoints - as a matter of fact, you may have, in one frame, several deer and wild buffalo with a lone elephant added! 

<h2>Safaris</h2>
Game rides are either atop trained elephants or by jeeps and happen between 7:30-9:30 am and again between 2-4 pm. All jeeps are accompanied by naturalists and an armed forest guard, in case a wild elephant or a rhino decides to charge! 

Although jeep rides have better chance of spotting wildlife, being atop an elephant, padding silently in the morning mist through the grass-lands is a wondrous experience. Elephant safaris during early morning or late in the evening make it possible for visitors to observe the wild animals from close quaters. The Elephants drivers or mahouts also act as guides, who provide information about the park and wildlife as you move along. these rides happen between 5-6 am & 6-7 pm.

The park is open from 1st November to 30th April, unless due to the rains in any exceptional year the park has to be closed earlier by the management for safety reasons.

They built havelis lavishly decorated with frescoes which became the symbol of the status of the Marwaris and a home for their extended family, providing security and comfort in style. ",1,mandawa.jpg,mandawa_2.jpg,265,27,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,1,"<h2>Painted Havelis</h2>
A dry and arid region bordering the Thar desert, Shekhavati nonetheless played a very important part in the camel trade from central Asia to the east. Camel caravans would stop here for shelter and well-earned rest. The smart trading community here exploited opportunities this opened up and in turn became prosperous. To date, some of the major trading families control a substantial part of the Indian economy. 

For themselves, in their home towns, these traders created impressive havelis. Maybe to compensate for the dry and colourless region, they decorated their havelis with grand frescoes and murals. The tradition of fresco paintings gave patronage to thousands of artists. There was an unspoken competition between the merchants to have more opulent, more intricate carvings. 

Popular themes in the frescoes are scenes from the life of gods like Krishna and stories from Ramayana and Mahabharata. The increasing contact with the western world resulted in some fanciful paintings: Gods riding cars, airplanes, trains, soldiers, even the British Queen and her entourage! 

The Suez Canal made the silk route redundant and the many traders moved on to fresher markets like Bombay and Calcutta. For years, the havelis lay in disuse, and it is only in the last two decades, since the arrival of tourists, that interest in this deserted area has been revived. 

The main towns of Shekhawati are Sikar, Nawalgarh, Dunlod, Mandawa, Jhunjhunu and Fatehpur but some of the earliest painted havelis are found in the town of Mandawa. The Saraf, Chokhani and Goenka Havelis are especially worth visiting. Shekhawati is a photographer's delight.

Perched along the Vindhya ranges at an altitude of 2,000 feet, Mandu, with its natural defenses, was originally the fort capital of the Parmar rulers of Malwa, which later came to be ruled by the Pathan Sultans of Malwa. These Sultans created this exquisite expanse of pleasure palace, tombs and gates. Each of Mandu's structures is an architectural gem. Some are outstanding like the massive Jami Masjid and Hoshang Shah's tomb, which provided inspiration to the master builders of the Taj Mahal centuries later.

<h2>The Darwazas</h2>
The 45 km walls that encircle Mandu are punctuated by 12 gateways. Most notable of these is Delhi Darwaza, the main entrance to the fortress city, the approach to which is through a series of well fortified gateways.

<h2>Jahaz Mahal</h2>
This 120 meter long ""ship palace"" built between the two artificial lakes, Munj Talao and Kapur Talao, is an elegant two storied palace, probably meant for the sultan's large harem. With its open pavilions and balconies overhanging the water and open terrace, Jahaz Mahal is an imaginative recreation in stone of a royal pleasure craft. 

Viewed on moonlit nights from the adjoining Taveli Mahal, the silhouette of the building, with the tiny domes and turrets of the pavilion gracefully perched on the terrace, presents an unforgettable spectacle.

<h2>Hindola Mahal</h2>
An audience hall, also belonging to Ghiyas-ud-din's reign, it derives its name of ""swinging palace"" from its sloping sidewalls. Superb and innovative techniques are also evident in its ornamental facade, delicate trellis work in sand-stone and beautifully moulded columns.

<h2>Hoshang Shah's Tomb</h2>
India's first marble edifice, it is one of the most refined examples of Afghan architecture. Its unique features are the magnificently proportioned dome, marble lattice work of remarkable delicacy and porticoed courts and towers to mark the four corners of the rectangle. Shah Jehan sent four of his great architects to study the design of, and draw inspiration from, the Tomb. Among them was Ustad Hamid, who was also associated with the construction of Taj Mahal.

<h2>Jami Mashid</h2>
Inspired by the great mosque of Damascus, the Jami Masjid was conceived on a grand scale, with a high plinth and a huge domed porch projecting in the centre, the background dominated by similar imposing domes with the intervening space filled with innumerable domes. One is struck by the huge proportions and the stern simplicity of its construction. The great court of the mosque is enclosed on all sides by huge colonnades with a rich and pleasing variety of arches and pillars, with numerous bays topped by rows of domes above.

<h2>Baz Bahadur's Palace</h2>
Built by Baz Bahadur in the early 16th century, the palace's unique features are its spacious courtyards surrounded by halls and high terraces offering superb views of the surrounding countryside.

Mysterious fires continued to raze down portions of Shaniwar Wada in the early 19th century, and the entire palace -- barring its Mirror Hall was burnt in the fire that broke out for about a fortnight.

nagarkhana with its fine wooden pillars and lattice work. One enters the palace through sturdy doors designed to dissuade enemy attacks. This palace is located in the narrow winding old part of the city. The palace is open from 0800 hrs to 1830 hrs. This site is covered in the Pune city tour.

Vijai Lal, who traces his family's presence in Pragpur back several generations, made every effort to preserve the village and his own heritage. This impetus to village crafts and architecture has resulted in the revival of skills like weaving and silver work and the conservation of the mud walls, original plasterwork and slate roofs that adorn the Pragpur houses.

Hindus visit Pushkar all year round to take a dip in the purifying waters of the lake, but the Kartika full moon night which usually is in the beginning of November (depending on the cycle of the moon) is believed to be the most auspicious day to do so. During the 4 days leading up to and including the full moon, Pushkar hosts thousands of celebrating devotees following prescribed rituals at the lake side and in the Brahma Temple. 

In the week leading up to the official start of the Pushkar Festival, a large camel fair is held in the sandy flats west of the town for the start of the fair. There is brisk trading and parading of camels, horses and cattle. To add to the flurry of colour and festivity, a huge carnival is held at the fair ground including cattle races, plays, a funfair and a circus with performers such as tightrope walkers.

",1,"Shillong is the capital city of Meghalaya. Recent development has been insensitive and haphazard, but the surrounding hills still retain many English style country houses. There is a vast bustling market, Bara Bazaar, to which thousands of Khasi tribespeople flock from their villages, selling everything from gold jewellery to spices and textiles. The market is dominated by Khasi women, who run most of the stalls. These cheerful matriarchs can drive a hard bargain. Police Bazaar resembles a Mall road as is found in many other hill stations in the evenings.",1,shillong.jpg,"",373,19,,,,,,,,,,1,0,,,2,"<h2>Shillong</h2>
This charming hill station is the capital of Meghalaya (meaning the home of clouds). Due to its cool climate and safe location above the Brahmaputra, Shillong was formerly the capital of the North-East. The state of Meghalaya was carved out of Assam in 1972 when the capital of Assam was shifted to Dispur and Shillong remained the capital of Meghalaya. 

Shillong and the surrounding Jaintia hills are home to Khasi tribe. Known for their beautiful people, Khasis follow a matrilineal system, where the property is carried down through the mother to the daughters and where married women keep their maiden names. In fact, the married male often takes his wife's name!  

During the period of the Raj, the British and rich Bengalis built cottages, a golf course and polo grounds in Shillong. Colonial Shillong was ranged around the attractive Ward's Lake. Unfortunately, the city's once-famous half-timbered architecture has largely been replaced by drab concrete but areas like Oakland retain many older houses, and even in the centre a few gems remain such as the All Saint's Cathedral.   

Shillong has a vast bustling market, Bara Bazaar, where thousands of Khasi tribespeople flock in from their villages selling everything from gold jewellery, spices to textiles. The market is dominated by Khasi women, who run most of the stalls. These cheerful matriarchs can drive a hard bargain.

The Police Bazaar is like a Mall road in many other hill stations in the evenings. There are food stalls by the dozen, shops selling an amazing number of things and the whole atmosphere is quite energetic. 

Shillong is the main centre of education in the 7 north-eastern states and as a result has a large student population which gives the town a young and buzzing feel. Shillong is very fond of pop and rock music and weekends see many rock bands playing at various venues. 

Apart from the centre, post-colonial Shillong hasn't worn well. Haphazard growth and deforestation of the surrounding hills have led to an acute water shortage in a state which has maximum rainfall. An increase in cars leads nowadays to regular traffic jams on the narrow roads. Migration has created intense communal pressures over the years with the Kasi population reacting with hostility to the influx of Bengalis and other outside groups. In spite of all this, Shillong is still a delightful city and a visit to the North-East won't be really complete without it.

<h2>Cherrapunjee</h2>
The road to Cherrapunjee through the East Khasi Hills winds through dense pine and oak forests, full of ferns and orchids. En route are dramaric gorges and ravines, eaterfalls and limestone caves. 

Along the way you may see some plateaus dotted with stone megaliths. These commemorate some good people for their works in the community or some special achievements. The road also passes through a quaint village called 'the village of small people'.

Cheerapunjee is one of the wettest places on earth. It continues to record an average rainfall of 1,143 cm in the monsoon months July to September. Rain and fog are constant here and give the place a certain melancholy beauty. And when the sun actually comes out, it is worth the effort to come here as the incredible scenery is revealed. 

Cherrapunjee and its surroundings also have curious `living bridges'. Living ficus elastica tree-roots, a rubber tree with its strong aerial roots, are bent and guided ingeneously across a stream/river and in a span of ten to fifteen years the bridge is ready to cross!. across a narrow stream to form a bridge to cross it. These Tolkienesque `root-bridges' can last a long time and are incredibly sturdy. 

It is worthwhile to descend 14 km down the narrow road to Mashamok for views back up to the falls and cliffs. Few places in the North East are more scenic. 

<h2>The Nongkrem Dance Festival in the Khasi Hills</h2> 
Nongkrem Dance is a religious festival in thanksgiving to God for good harvest, peace and prosperity of the community. It is held annually during October/ November, at Smit, the capital of the Khyrim Syiemship near Shillong.

The dance is performed in the open by young virgins and men, both bachelors and married. The women dressed in expensive silk costumes with heavy gold, silver and coral ornaments dance in the inner circle of the arena. The men form an outer circle and dance to the accompaniment of music of flutes and drums. An important feature of the festival is the 'Pomblang' or goat sacrifice offered by the subjects to the Syiem of Khyrim, the administrative head of the Hima (Khasi State). Ka Syiem Sad, the eldest sister of the king is the chief priest and caretaker of all ceremonies. The festival is conducted alongwith the Myntries (Ministers), priests and high priest where offerings are made to ancestors of the ruling clan and the deity of Shillong.",25.5667,91.8833,India,shillong,"Shillong has been called the `Scotland of the East' because of its temperate climate and its location at an altitude of 1,500 metres.

Passing on his kingdom to his defeated brother, Bhahubali adopted a life of meditation. T

Thousands of devotees congregate here to perform the `Mahamastakabhisheka', a spectacular ceremony held once in 12 years, when the 1000-year-old statue is anointed with milk, curds, ghee, saffron and gold coins. The next Mahamastakabhisheka is due in 2005

And Karnataka continues to be India's largest producer of coffee. Other reminders of the colonial past are the spacious estate bungalows, many of which still have British names, and the meandering roads that wind through the district.

Modern Ujjain is situated on the banks of the river Shipra, regarded since times immemorial as sacred. The belief in the sacredness of Shipra, has its origins in the ancient Hindu mythological tale of churning of the Ocean by the Gods and the Demons, with Vasuki, the serpent as the rope. The ocean bed first yielded fourteen gems, then Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth, and finally the coveted vessel of Nectar. Then began the wild scramble for immortality with the demons chasing the Gods across the skies, and in the process, a few drops were spilt, and fell at Hardwar, Nasik, Prayag, and Ujjayini. Hence the sanctity of the waters of the Shipra.

Ijjain is one of the four centres of the Kumbh Mela, attracting a few million pilgrims every 12 years. At other times, a constant stream of pilgrims come to bathe in the river Shipra and worship at the temples.

Today, Ujjain abounds in temples, hoary old tradition attached to each of them. But though most of them have been built upon sites of antiquity, none of them has survived in the original splendour. Desecrated and despoiled time and time again, the structures that stand today are of more recent date, renovated or rebuilt over the years. And yet, the temples form an integral part of the city and contribute to the continuity of Ujjain's tradition of greatness.

The road to Cherrapunji through the East Khasi Hills winds through dense pine and oak forests, full of ferns and orchids. En route are dramaric gorges and ravines, eaterfalls and limestone caves. 

Along the way you may see some plateaus dotted with stone megaliths. These commemorate some good people for their works in the community or some special achievements. The road also passes through a quaint village called 'the village of small people'.

Cheerapunji is one of the wettest places on earth. It continues to record an average rainfall of 1,143 cm in the monsoon months July to September. Rain and fog are constant here and give the place a certain melancholy beauty. And when the sun actually comes out, it is worth the effort to come here as the incredible scenery is revealed. 

Cherrapunji and its surroundings also have curious `living bridges'. Living ficus elastica tree-roots, a rubber tree with its strong aerial roots, are bent and guided ingeneously across a stream/river and in a span of ten to fifteen years the bridge is ready to cross!. across a narrow stream to form a bridge to cross it. These Tolkienesque `root-bridges' can last a long time and are incredibly sturdy. 

It is worthwhile to descend 14 km down the narrow road to Mashamok for views back up to the falls and cliffs. Few places in the North East are more scenic.

<h2>Trek to the living root bridges</h2>
The trek to the living root bridges takes approximately 5 hours for the round trip. Guides are available at Cherrapunjee Holiday Resort for a fixed charge of Rs 600/-. It is possible to do the trek without a guide, as there is some rudimentary signposting on the paths, but it is not advisable in case of accidents/vertigo, etc. 

You first drive 5km from Cherrapunjee Holiday Resort to the trailhead. Then walk down approximately 2000 well made concrete steps into the valley. From the village at the bottom, where there is a simple homestay and a couple of rudimentary shops, one path heads right for about 15 minutes to a spectacular single root bridge. Another undulating path heads left for about 45 minutes across 2 modern wire suspension bridges to the even more spectacular ""double deck"" root bridge. There are small swimming pools in the river here, and some large ones a further 30 minutes uphill walk beyond here. 

There is an ""entry"" fee of Rs 10 per person, plus Rs20 for cameras. Then retrace your steps to the village, and back up the 2000 steps to the trailhead, where the car and driver are waiting.",25.3,91.7,India,cherrapunji,"Cherrapunji is the place which once received the heaviest rainfall in the world.

When the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan decided to move back from Agra to Delhi in 1638, he built within 10 years the huge city of Shah Jahanabad, now known as Old Delhi. The main street is Chandni Chowk, a fascinating bustling jumble of craft shops, traders, mosques and temples.

The magnificent Red Fort contains opulent palaces and impressive public buildings. The Fort is modeled on the Red Fort in Agra from where the Mughal capital shifted to Delhi.

Near the Red Fort is the magnificent Jama Masjid, the largest mosque in India, built by Shah Jehan, the creator of the ethereal Taj Mahal.

South of New Delhi are the Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tomb, both World Heritage Sites. The Qutab Minar has a 5-storey, 72-metre victory tower of red sandstone.

Further ahead at Jagdalpur, at the head of the main bazaar, lies the royal enclave.

In winters or after the rains, you can avail of boat rides on the lake (anything between Rs 10 and 50 for half an hour). Close to the lake is the splendid Danteshwari Temple.

<h2>Around Jagdalpur</h2>
38 km NW of Jagdalpur are the Chitrakot waterfalls. This is where the Indravati River bids adieu to the plateau of Bastar and plunges 94 ft down the ravine. The horseshoe-shaped Chitrakot Waterfall happens to be the most advertised tourist spot of the region. The picturesque locale was also home to the anthropologist Verrier Elwin. 

35 km SE of Jagdalpur is the Kanger Valley National Park, home to the Dhurwa tribe, an easy ride from Jagdalpur. There is a Forest Suraksha Samiti, a co-operative comprising villagers working as guides and guards in the park. If you just want to visit the national park, start from Jagdalpur in the morning. When you get to the entrance of the park, hire a guide who can show you around the stalactites and stalagmites in the Kutumsar and Dandak Caves. Do not miss the sunset at the Kanger Dhara River or a visit to the scenic Tirathgarh Falls. 

The Kanger National Park is open from November to June, but you can visit the Tirathgarh Falls round the year.

A stay in Dasada includes cross-desert safaris across the Little Rann of Kutch in open vehicles. 

The Rann of Kutch is a geographically unique landscape that was once an arm of the Arabian Sea. As the land became separated from the sea by geological forces, a vast, featureless plain encrusted with salt was formed, which is inundated with water during the monsoon rains. 
 
The safari across the Little Rann visits the 'bets', islands on the ancient seabed that are now higher ground covered with grass and scrub.

These 'bets' support a variety of wildlife including the 'Gudkhur' (Asiatic wild ass) that is not found elsewhere. The wild ass is a handsome chestnut brown member of the equus genus (horse family). Capable of reaching high speeds when galloping across the Rann, the wild ass is usually seen in small herds. 

The elegant blackbuck (Indian antelope), nilgai or blue bull (India's largest antelope) and the graceful chinkara (Indian gazelle) are other mammals seen.

The carnivores of the Little Rann are the endangered Indian wolf, desert fox, Indian fox, jackals, desert and jungle cats, and a few hyenas.

The best sightings can be made at the lakes and marshes in and around the Rann where birds gather in numbers beyond comprehension during the winter months from October to March. These are the months when large droves of demoiselle and common cranes are seen in incredibly large numbers. The wetlands also attract flamingos, pelicans, storks, ibises, spoonbill, a variety of ducks and other waterfowl. 

The Rann is also the hunting ground of raptors like the short-toed eagle, aquila eagles, six species of falcon, buzzards and three species of harrier.

Pench Tiger Reserve comprises the Indira Priyadarshini Pench National Park, the Mowgli Pench Sanctuary and a buffer. The Park nestles in the Southern slopes of the Satpura ranges of Central India. The river Pench, which splits the National Park into two, forms the lifeline of the Park. The park is open from 16th October till 30th June.

<h2>Topography</h2> 
The terrain of the park is undulating with mainly gentle slopes criss-crossed by streams and nullahs. Most of these water courses are seasonal. Many of the hills are flat-topped and allow fine vistas of the forests around. The best known of these is 'Kalapahar' with an altitude of 650 mts. The Pench river flowing through the centre of the Reserve is dry by April but a number of water pools locally known as 'dohs' are found, which serve as waterholes for wild animals. A few perennial springs also exist. Recently a number of earthen ponds and shallow wells have been developed leading to well distributed sources of water all around the reserve.

<h2>Conservation History</h2>
In the year 1977 an area of 449.39 sq km was declared Pench Sanctuary. Out of this, an area of 292.85 sq km was declared Pench National Park in the year 1983 and 118.31 sq km remained as Pench Sanctuary. In 1992 Government of India declared 757.89 sq km area including the National Park and the sanctuary as the 19th Tiger Reserve of the country. The name of Pench National Park was changed to ""Indira Priyadarshini Pench National Park"" in November 2002 Similarly the name of Pench Sanctuary has been changed to ""Mowgli Pench Sanctuary"". 

The Pench hydroelectric dam straddles the Maharashtra - Madhya Pradesh boundary. The dam, constructed between 1973 and 1988 has resulted in the submergence of about 74 sq km area out of which 54 km is in the Park, the rest being in Maharashtra.

<h2>Forests and Wildlife</h2>
The undulating topography supports a mosaic of vegetation ranging from moist, sheltered valleys to open, dry deciduous forest. Over 1200 species of plants have been recorded from the area including several rare and endangered plants as well as plants of ethno-botanical importance.

The area has always been rich in wildlife. It is dominated by fairly open canopy, mixed forests with considerable shrub cover and open grassy patches. The high habitat heterogeneity favours high population of Chital and Sambar. Pench tiger reserve has highest density of herbivores in India (90.3 animals per sq km).

The area is especially famous for large herds of Gaur (Indian Bison), Cheetal, Sambar, Nilgai, Wild Dog and Wild Pig. The key predator is the Tiger followed by Leopard, Wild Dog and Wolf. Other animals include Sloth Bear, Chousingha, Chinkara, Barking Deer, Jackal, Fox, Palm Civet, Small Indian Civet, Jungle Cat, Hyena, Porcupine etc.

There are over 285 species of resident and migratory birds including the Malabar Pied Hornbill, Indian Pitta, Osprey, Grey-headed Fishing Eagle, White-eyed Buzzard, etc. In winter thousands of migratory waterfowl including Brahmini Duck, Pochards, Barheaded Geese, Coots, etc visit the tanks and the Pench reservoir within the Park.

Pench Tiger Reserve is also among the best areas for bird watching. Four species of the now endangered vultures white-rumped, longbilled, white scavenger and king vulture can be seen in good numbers in the Reserve. The other fauna present include 50 species of fishes, 10 amphibians, 30 reptiles, 45 butterflies, 54 moths and numerous other insects.

It is easy to forget that Majuli is an island, holding within it hills, vast open paddy fields, rivulets, dry sandy river beds and corpses of thick trees. Majuli falls along a major migratory path for ducks, geese and other birds. As a result, an extra-ordinary large number of birds can be seen here, even just simply by driving or cycling around. We saw Purple Moorhens by hundreds, a great number of egrets and herons and a number of Lesser and Greater Adjutant storks.   

<h2>Vaishnavite Monasteries</h2>
As interesting as Majuli's distinctive landscape are its satras, unique monasteries, established in the 15th century by a visionary reformer-philosopher, Shankardeva. Translating Sanskrit texts into Assamese, he broke the monopoly of Brahmins and made them accessible to common people. The fundamental idea behind the monastic life was to simplify faith and getting rid of elaborate rituals to concentrate on the actual object of faith. 

Entering the Satra compound, one leaves behind one's footwear and hopefully one's arrogance. The monks, all males, live in simple and clean rooms, connected through long, common verandahs. The monks here are divided in small `families' of 3 - an older monk, a monk who is the bread winner and the youngest, the student. They live together in a small `boha', which is their family home. 

At the centre of the Satra is the Naamghar - a prayer hall where monks gather to enact plays, music and dance. The satras are rich depositories of traditional Assamese arts and crafts, and regularly stage dance dramas in praise of Vishnu. Many of the monks have been invited to perform all over the country and even overseas. Watching one of the performances is a riveting experience.",26.95,94.1667,India,majuli,"Majuli is the largest river island in the world.

Just a few decades ago, the Konyaks were still head-hunters and you will still find elderly men with the typically Naga tattoed faces, who would have been involved in the tradional head-hunting at one time. As most of Nagaland has been converted to Christianity, the custom has now been outlawed.


",1,,,536,23,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,2,"<h2>Mon</h2>
The drive from Dibrugarh to Mon is not for the faint-hearted. The road changes from monotonous concrete to a tyer-marked trail. The road from Mon down to Wakching is excellent but the short-cut from here to Mokokchung is again only for those with a thirst for adventure.

The town of Mon is located in a broad valley of the northern Naga hills. Mon is a new town, having come into being just about 40 years ago to create a district headquarter. Since this is the biggest town in this part of Nagaland, traders and small producers congregate here selling river fish, vegetables and herbs. 

Mon is a fairly un-remarkable town without a true centre. The one large open space here is the stadium which is also the venue for the annual festivals. Roads in dire need of repair wind around seemingly aimlessly. There are no buildings of particular interest apart from the few churches which stand out, taller than the rest. 

Mon also has very few decent places to stay. The two government tourist bungalows can provide adequate if not too comfortable places to stay, when functional. The only `restaurant' we found, didn't seem to have a name, but did offer some simple fare including hot momos and plate of noodles. Beware in Mon, the trade comes to an end by about 5 pm. Yes, that includes the restaurant. 

Despite the serious lack of accommodation options, Mon is the best base from which to see some of the most interesting tribes in Nagaland. Mon district is the land of the Konyak tribes and in remote villages you may still be able to admire the former head hunters with their tattooed faces ears pierced with horns. Konyaks are still ruled by heredetary chiefs known as Angh. As an outside visitor you normally need permission from the local Angh to visit a village and a fee may be charged for this.

If you visit Mon during the beginning of April, you'll be able to witness Konyaks all over Mon celebrating the Aoleong Monyu festival. Undertaken to welcome spring and pray for bountiful harvests, this happy week-long festival has plenty of feasting and sacrifices to appease the divine forces that watch over the farms. 

<h2>Lungwa</h2>
Just a two-hour drive from Mon is the village of Lungwa, situated right on the Myanmar border. In fact, the chief's house is bisected longitudinally by the border. When you visit the chief's house you will therefore have the strange experience of sitting near the hearth with half your body in Myanmar and the other half still in India. It's not the only unusual thing -- the chief also has dozens of wives! The chief's house, filled with dubious trophies of various animal skulls, is also quite an interesting sight.

<h2>Shangnyu</h2>
This is a prominent village in Mon district, ruled by the Chief Angh. There is a wonderful wooden monument measuring 8 feet in height and 12 feet in breadth- believed to have been constructed by heavenly angels. Human beings and other creatures are carved on this monument. Memorial stones are also found in front of the Angh's Palace. History records that good and friendly relationship existed between the Shangnyu and the Ahom Kings of Assam. Shangnyu Angh use to collect taxes from all the villages under his domain-extending from Sibsagar in Assam to the Wanchos in Arunachal.

<h2>Shengha Chingyu </h2>
Unfortunately, both Longwa and Shangnyu have been affected by the visit of travellers in recent years. Local headhunters have turned into sellers of tacky souvenirs in order to earn some extra money. The village of Shengha Chingyu is more off the beaten track and not visited as yet by many outsiders so the atmosphere is more relaxed. The Angh is young and modern and lives with his family in an impressive large house on top of the hill. Outside is a board which mentions that his father, who died in 2001, was married to 18 wives and had hunted 130 heads in his lifetime.

Mokokchung is the cultural center of the Ao people and is economically and politically the most important urban centre in Northern Nagaland. In fact it is the most important urban hub in all of Nagaland after Dimapur and Kohima. 

Historically, Mokokchung was one of the initial locations in the Naga Hills, where the Assam Rifles, led by Britishers, first established their outposts (then called stockades) in the later part of 19th century. Much of the town initially grew around this post located in the DC Hill. The British administration was then gradually extended eastwards towards the remoter parts of the Naga Hills. Today, Mokokchung is considered to be one of the most beautiful, culturally vibrant and friendly cities of North East India, and of Nagaland in particular.

Longkhum village is located on the highest hill top in Mokokchung district, an hour's drive (17 km) from Mokokchung, just off the road to Kohima. It used to be famous for head hunting in the past and the Nagas believe that it is the resting placed for spirits of the dead en route to paradise. You are expected to come again to Longkhum to collect your spirit which is likely to stay behind. Longkhum, commands lovely views and locals make ethnic handicrafts and handloom products. 

Near Longkhum is a ridge of stones (called Longlangba or stone bridge) that passes through the Rhododendron woods. It appears to be manmade. It is a path made with stone which makes it convenient to walk through the woods.The forest has small holes in the rocks that were carved into the stones so that spears could be placed in them. These were like warning signs to attackers that they would be killed and their head taken off.

They come to Trashigang to trade yak's butter for the provisions that they need in the mountains.

",1,,,570,28,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,2,"In 1860, the British sent an expedition to Sikkim. When the force reached Rinchenpong, the Lepchas (the original inhabitants of Sikkim) used herbs to poison the water of a pond, the only source of water in Rinchenpong, thus killing half the British forces and forcing them to retreat. 

The pond was christened Poison Pokhri and is one of the earliest examples of bio-chemical warfare. It can still be seen but the small, almost dry water body is nothing impressive. But don't be disheartened - the mountains in Rinchenpong are fascinating enough.

If you wake up early in Rinchenpong, you will be greeted by a spectacular sunrise on the Kanchenjunga and its sister peaks. One by one Kanchenjunga, Rathong, Kabru, Kumbhakarna, Pandim and the other peaks will catch the crimson rays of the rising sun, turning the entire massif into a bright shade of red.

Apart from great mountain views, Rinchenpong has something more to offer. A series of winding stone-paved trails leads one past Lepcha traditional houses and old British forest bungalows to ancient monasteries housing rare idols. The trail passes through a beautiful forest, with the snowy peaks of the Himalayas towering above the treetops.

Bidding farewell to Rinchenpong monastery, you can follow a jungle trail to a staircase leading to Resume monastery, run by two young lamas. Unfortunately it is in a rundown state but its location on a ridge-top overlooking the sleepy hamlet of Rinchenpong affords a grand view. 

If you follow the steps downwards you can take a short diversion to a traditional Lepcha house. Built in the original Lepcha style, the house doubles up as an artefacts shop.
